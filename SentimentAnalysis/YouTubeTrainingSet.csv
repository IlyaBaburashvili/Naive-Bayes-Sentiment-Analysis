0,"My biggest problem with AI Art is that it devalues the time and energy artists pour into honing their skill, thus making any future artists hesitant about becoming an artist because an AI can do it better, faster AND for a lot less. If a bot can make art better than you, faster than you, and cheaper than your prices then what's the point of working as an artist? None. This can, if handled even a bit poorly, kill off a large part of the artist community simply because they've been shown up by a bot and feel like they've just wasted their time."
2,When new mommy Ina model?
2,"Ina just like a lot of people are misinformed on how these AI work and i don't blame them because most people have no clue, because honestly this stuff is almost wizardry, those who don't know really should take the time and see how it really works, there's plenty of videos explaining this in great detail.
The model itself does not contain a ""database of images"" that uses to copy paste stuff like an interpolation or extrapolation  collage machine.
It simply doesn't work that way, after it learns from the images it does not ""trace"" from them because it doesn't store them at all, it literally is making a new image from scratch entirely, just like a human would do if they learned how to draw.
A Human doesn't need ""permission"" from another artists to ""copy"" or imitate their style as long as it's not literally the same image or bases their image on their work (and the AI doesn't do that either, it doesn't use something as a base unless you the person explicitly and intentionally do it yourself with img2img).
If someone, a traditional artist, copied someone else's drawing style, they can do it and do whatever they want with it, there's many cases where someone imitated someone's style and managed to do it even better than the original and there's nothing they can do about it legally.
It quite literally learned just like a human would, by looking at images, not storing them.
If it stored them and copied from then it would lose the entire point of an AI that draws by itself, the idea of these AI is to being able to do stuff by themselves with the least input possible and that's what people don't get, (And in fact the model itself would be TBs in size if it stored the images, the model got leaked and it isn't nearly as big as that, in fact you could try to reverse engineer it's code and try to get the images from it, and you wouldn't be able to, simply because the images are not stored in any shape of form, they are not there, it doesn't need the images anymore, that's why there's nothing illegal about it)
As it stands now it's just a tool, if they want to sell they AI generations they can do that too no problem, it's okay as long as you are not doing anything illegal and you are upfront that you are using AI, because if someone wants to buy AI images that's their own business, they decide what they do with their own money, i repeat, if they want to buy images knowing it's AI generated it is their problen because it's their money.
It has it's limitations, consistency is one of them so someone ""pretending to be an artist"" using AI without telling anybody isn't realistic without getting caught.

And because AI is jsut a tool, there will be people better than others at using it, if you want something random yeah you can just use a prompt and there you go, but if you want something very specific it's not gonna be as easy to make it happen exactly how you want and that's where actual artistic skill comes into play in combination with AI, it might become another field in digital art or it could just become an integral part just like when photoshop came out, when photoshop and similar software got popular there was pretty much this same discussion going on which is silly to think about now, and this aswell will be silly some years from now, specially because this is just the ""on diapers"" era of AI generated images, it's gonna get much more scary.
With all of that said, AI will push traditional artists to improve their own creativity, not the other way around, AI right now has a lot of limitations, things that only real people can make, such as visual comedy or complex drawings.
With AI you can have very well drawn stuff but that doesn't mean it's complex and creative just because it's well drawn, it's still going to come down to the creativity of people, for now until AIs that understand english start making stuff without human input and figure out how ""creativity"" works (because even that has it's method), probably at 10 years or more from now, until then artists should just focus on improving their own stuff, this won't take their jobs as long as they keep being creative.

TL;DR Only scrub artists are worried about this, if you're actually creative (even if you lack skill doesn't mean you cannot be more creative than an AI and have it look good) you have nothing to worry about, artists who are actually skilled and creative (and that understand how this really work) are not worried about this stuff, Ina isn't either it's just that she is misinformed and is worried that other people's work are being illegally used.
And with scrubs i mean artists that instead of focusing on improving they just want to complain, specially those who are not that good, now they will be forced to go beyond ""just drawing well"" if they want to sell a sketch for 100 USD , they need to get creative now and most people suck at that, not even an AI has figured out how that works, yet.
an AI isn't magic either, boring people using it will generate boring images, it is not sentient, if you want something funky and stylized it won't do it by itself, if there was some kind of AI art tournament or competition, i guarantee you the winner won't win by pure luck or coincidence and will consistently make better AI art than the others, and that's because you can go beyond just typing a prompt."
0,"I feel this whole thing is gonna just...
not fuck over the ai company and they'll keep their database while boorus everywhere just get fucked."
1,"It's great to see a big name vTuber bringing up some of the actual ethical issues with the way researchers gather data, and big data harvests image sets to sell to researchers. So many of talents are just like, ""Technology is scary and people who use modern tools aren't real artists. durr,"" without giving any consideration to what kind of damage they might do to people's livelihoods, so this is really refreshing."
2,Streamers should just make AI art tags.
2,"honestly its all comes down to effort, i like the potential of Ai Art but i dislike that people claim they are an ""Artist"" or have good art when its all just a couple minutes of typing and a click no matter if its fair use or not"
2,"Imo, it's a tool like any other. The good artists may use it as a source of inspiration - I.E: think of it like being in a character customizer in a game, and hitting random until you have a baseline you like and tweaking it from there.

Personal opinion, which may be optimistic, it helps speed up the turnaround time of good artists, and weed out hacks.
I mean, anime has already been using AI generation to animate the ""in-between"" frames for a long time now."
2,ai generated images are really fascinating but it shouldn't be called art whatsoever
2,"AI art is a weird thing. What do we make of it when it eventually becomes legitimate artificial intelligence, instead of just a fancy machine-learning algorithm? As of now, as she said, it's trained using internet repositories which has... questionable moral implications, at best. But what do we make of it when it can teach itself instead of simply mimicking and combining the work of others?"
2,"Humans are dynamic, biological, pattern machines, AI models haven't been developed yet to become dynamic. We learn from images, visions, thoughts over many years. An AI model, as of now, can specialize in weeks/days/hours in limited areas. As long as art looks like art, then it is art, regardless how it came to be.

We consume daily computer generated content without batting an eye, so I stick to the turing test standard."
2,"My opinion: It isn't fan art..  

The computer made the art and the computer isn't a fan. The fan isn't who made the art an ai made it. So if it wasn't the fans art because the fan didn't go out of their way to make art and showcase their appreciation as a fan.

It isn't fanart. It's just a picture... likely extrapulation of someones actual fanart."
0,"As an upcoming artist myself 
I really don't like AI art 
I love the fact that anyone who can't can create a piece of their imaginations n ideas

But it take away from all the artist hardwork, there should be a totally different tag for it n a water mark for AI stuff. 

It takes years to get where we are, good or bad n it takes months and years just to get 1 technique right
There lighting, shading, colour Theo, brushes, anatomy, layer blends, etc. 
And for an AI to come n potentially steal or out shine your years of hard work just sucks. 

If this goes on why would anyone ever want to do digital work anymore."
2,I’m not sure how I feel about non artists posting AI works on websites like pixiv. It just doesn’t feel right
0,"if you post your art publically you don't get to decide who sees it even if that ""who"" is an ai. artists either need to stop posting shit publicly or stop complaining"
2,"An additional point to the AI art thing, tangential to the ethical bits, is that AI art is simply much faster to produce- think up a prompt and you technically get like 10 or so works per minute. I think Pixiv is currently experiencing volumes of AI art significantly outnumbering human creations. So part of the problem would be AI art simply drowning out original human works, so it'd be preferrable to keep it separated if only just for ease of use for everyone browsing."
2,"Wait she hasn’t made an NSFW Tag in 2 years? No wonder it was an issue lel. I’m guessing Ina also has an issue with Google Images then, because Google Images also technically reposts art without asking the artists





That aside Ina is great and i think InAppropriate is my favorite lel, especially because its much more obvious than a funny in reference like the 4th wah lel"
2,"can't wait for AI to make art without artist input, how are you gonna bitch about it then when its art is gonna be better than yours?"
2,what if my family is into alabama sex?
2,"Putting aside the actual problems  people have with AI, I agree with not having AI art along with fanart drawn by other fans.
Completely glossing over the fact that in my opinion posting AI art as fanart for your favorite vtuber kinda misses the point of these tags, it would EASILY flood the whole tag and bury the rest of non-AI art.

I second someone else's statement that an AI art should exist for AI generated Ina fanart though. While I don't particularly like AI art, people are making it and if we don't want it somewhere specific we should give it another place where anyone interested can check it out. Otherwise we can't really complain that it's there, especially when we consider that tags are very important in making a work discoverable."
1,"I'm glad that this technology exists. Would I call it art? Not so sure. But it definitely makes us question current definitions of it. And yes, I don't really see the point of being upset about ""stealing"" when art is only used for training, it'll never produce a direct copy. Bad analogy would be me analyzing someone's style and eventually reproducing it, different low level approaches, but similar result."
1,"Just glad that Ina made her stand "" not okay "" on this, AI can be smart, but cant replace art draw by artist"
2,"i feel like at this point most vtubers should just have an art tag for AI art specifically to avoid some sort of streisand effect down the line.

also i'm kind of suprised the programmers/developers of these generators don't think to watermark these AI generated pictures in order to avoid this type of concern over ""art theft"" from ever happening as it's an easily avoided controversy that only brings unwanted negative attention to their project."
2,"While I would definitely prefer... a stronger statement from Ina, I'm glad she's spoken up on it and expressed her disagreement for AI art in official tags
Personally I believe NovelAI... should not be tolerated at all, creators training AI on art reposted without consent and additionally earning money with it should not be tolerated at all. The technology is one thing, the AI models available right now are something else. That's why I hoped for a stronger statement and I do hope that Ina isn't one of the artists that dismiss AI as it can't produce content high quality enough yet to directly endanger them, as it eventually will in future if things don't change. I do wish her statement was stronger not to raise such doubts

Please don't misunderstand my comment, with the actual danger of AI being released into the public I simply think being neutral/very softly negative is... the worst thing you can do as an artist as at this moment, we need action and strong statements and zero tolerance for current models"
2,Personal thought: I don't mind AI art as long it's for personal use (like making portraits for D&D characters) but should be ethically and technically avoided for professional use.
2,"You know, I kinda expected her to be not ok for a different reason
That is, that AI art shouldn't be consider ""Original Content"" of the one doing the prompt and posting it (I feel that would greatly defeat many's motivations to actually do art...)"
1,"AI art is useful! I use it for character images for my Tabletop campaigns because I have literally no art skills. 
But it's not something I would be proud of and upload anywhere as something I ""made"" or something."
1,Based Ina
2,You could create a different art tag for AI I supose
0,Ngl I think commision artist demand dropped about 70% when the AI came out which was alot of people's lively-hoods and thats pretty sad.
2,"While I agree that the AI art probably shouldn't be under the fanart tag, as it was made by an AI and not a fan, the hypocrisy around the discussion of is it stealing art to train an AI always annoys me. So it's fine for artists to take other artists works of art to look at and study without permission, but it's not fine for AI? I can outright guarantee that every artist out there has not gotten explicit permission to learn from every artist they've every learned anything from. If you think that training AI on works by artists that haven't agreed to let their works be studied is stealing, that's fine, but call out human artists too for doing the same shit."
2,"I'm not gonna lie... ... ...I was confused for a bit with the 4thWAH hashtag, since I had only heard it once way back when, and she didn't say what it meant, just that it was forbidden. Due to my constantly empty stomach, I mistook it for, ""We Are Hungry."" at the time, and stopped thinking about it.

Twitter has since explained it :I"
2,"I think a good resolve for this issue would be just creating a seperate art tag specifically for AI generated art. As Ina says in the clip, it's not going away. Why not provide and outlet for those images that doesn't interfere with actual art?"
2,"One of the worst things that can happen is a legit artist may be accused of using AI. Perhaps artists will have to return to using real media (canvas + paint) and artists will only paint ""real"" works for wealthy patrons."
0,That’s never gonna happen sorry not sorry🤷🏻‍♀️
1,"as you say 
 queen"
2,"""Quality of the input affects the quality of the output""

I think AI can have the potential to be a decent tool. The question should not be about the existence of the Ai tool, but rather it should be about the proper ownership of the Ai Input."
0,"kind of questioning the ""it's not copying it's learning from it.""
ye, 
if the AI only have 1 picture in it's database, it's just gonna copy it.
some artist gonna try to make differences,"
2,Bro real talk I tried to use the AI to make an Eldritch tentacle girl character for an RP story I'm doing with friends and it kept making the tentacles purple and the hair orange. I could see Ina everywhere.
2,"I get what she is trying to say, but I am fairly certain that art students that go to college study art by artists that may or may not even be alive to give consent for the use of their art. Who is going to consent for the art of Van Gogh or Leonardo da Vinci? No one alive should have the ability to deny the masses to such famous artists' works.

This means that the idea that art is studied by people in the same way is also inherently wrong according to Ina. I don't disagree, but I also don't think it is right to gatekeep great works of art from anyone, even an AI that is learning to make similar works of art."
0,Man I feel kinda bad for her
2,i think the hashtag should be forbidden wah
0,"Yes, that is the thing about AI art. If AI art was actually a AI trained to draw and would make art pieces from scratch, then I would be okay with it. But its not, the AI is actually taking someone else's art and using that to ""generate"" something. But the correct term would be ""the Ai is stealing art from an artist that has no way of protecting said art, and passing it out as an original piece"" THAT is why I'm against AI art, its not really AI art, its stolen art using an AI."
2,AI “art”? More like ai generated images.
2,"AI art is going to replace / heavily assist every form of digital art in the next ~10 years. 

Digital Art has no ""soul"" to begin with. This is something it has always struggled with. No one appreciates the craftsmanship behind digital art 

Time to go analog again."
1,"That's something I like about Ina that sets her apart from other vtubers: she's so cool and open-minded while keeping herself from expressing opinions on topics she's not familiar with. But when she does expresses her opinion she usually has a good deal of thought behind them. I guess she's just as prone to having knee-jerk reactions as anyone else, but she usually keeps those for herself until she's got a more thought out position 🤔"
1,"Ina is so reserved and careful with her wording choice! I think she as an artist that has said she leans more towards ""not okay"" with the whole AI shit going on, its not surprising she doesn't like how the tool is being used in this manner."
0,"Another video on AI art, another comment section full of people who have no clue how it generates images with the newest Stable Diffusion feature"
2,Think skynet is going to get triggered by all these people sayong AI art isnt the same as human art?
2,"AI art is good as an experiment, as a field study. It should exist as a novelty, rather than an alternative for real art created by real artists. 

An AI can write a top-grossing movie script. It doesn't mean that the movie is worth watching or remembering outside of surface level appeal."
2,"If there is a pro side of ai art, it would need to be a regulation of how it gets used. Like I do not mind if a company like Disney went off to utilize it for their animation projects with their own original art, that speeds up time and money for what can be amazing cinema. There's already a contractual clause where any animator's drawings while working at the company is owned by Disney. The input would still need to be processed by hard work and labor, but condensed in a bubble.  Right now, in ai art's current form it is very wild west of unfathomable possibility and anarchy."
2,How is it any different from artists using references though...?
1,Koahri is doing god's work.
2,"Yeah, but people that trained on the references also do it “without the artist’s consent”, soo…"
2,Baby takos cover your eyes
1,"Unless the AI itself loves watching Ina or Holomems streams in general and supporting them, its art can't be categorized as fan art."
2,"People need to understand that in art, one of the most fascinating things, is that someone can do, that certain thing, the work, the process, the time consumed all these thing makes artists, amazing.
But most people see it as, ""this looks as good as an human artist so AI art is amazing."""
2,No ai will get Ina back properly
2,"Anyone want to read my research paper? I basically just used a bot I found somewhere and it copy/pasted a bunch of stuff from Google for me, but *I* typed in the subject so it's *mine,* I swear!"
2,The AI art part is illegal under US copyright law but not one judge will do anything about it because of how complicated and out of date copyright law is.
1,"""not ideal"" is a good way to put it"
2,"Considering everything around AI imagery and Kim Jung Gi's death, it doesn't surprise me most artists aren't ok with it."
1,"Reminds me of when people complained about artists using digital art tools when they first started coming out.  Now they are accepted, it will be the same for Ai art, it just needs to be improved is all.  So yeah, I would agree.  For now."
0,"I, of course, respect her opinion, but I disagree on one point. If the AI was using other art to recreate that art, then sure. But as it is used, it's essentially just inspiration"
1,"I really appreciate Ina’s issues with AI art being based in fact (i.e. it’s *trained* on art that used without the artist’s consent) rather than misunderstanding (“it just mashes different bits of art together!”)

It’s fine to take issue with AI art, and we do need to have a discussion of the ethics of it going forward because as Ina says it’s not something that’s going to go away. And to that end, it’s especially important that the basic technical details aren’t misrepresented — which they sadly all too often are."
2,"This AI art thing is really scaring me. On one hand it would be cool if you can just have an AI make any image you wanna see (infinite lewds of all my favorite characters woo). But I really don’t want human-made art to go away, or for it to get a point where we can’t tell if it’s made by a human or AI."
2,Anyone who's seen how artists react to tracing (Nene incident comes to mind) knows what they probably think of AI art.
2,Art is the intersection between imagination and skills. You have artisans who are full skills and use less imagination. Then you have the AI « artists » who have no real skills but most don’t even have imagination and are happy to show whatever the AI give them.
2,"In my opinion everyone should have 3 art tags to satisfy the community. 1 for the regular art anything normal and fun, 2 for the NSFW ones for the spice people, and 3 for Ai art for those who just want to post what the Ai did.
I know not everyone will be respectful to post on what they should but I don't have any other ideas."
2,MIssed the chance to call it the 34th Wah.
2,"For AI art as long as it isn’t the same image then it’s a new image and should be treated as such. It would be like saying all cars are the same because one person invented a car and now everybody who makes cars after is simply ripping off the original design.
I get it people are afraid of losing their job as an artist, machines have been replacing people in all kinds of jobs. A machine that can learn will replace people even faster."
0,"Jesus Christ I'm sick and tired of Ina constantly whining about stuff.  How many times has she called out her chat now?  10?  I'm glad she's taking an extended break, but it needs to be a permanent one.  Permanent."
1,"BASED INA!
A real artist would've known not to touch on those AI stuffs: they are good but the ppl who used it and claimed it as theirs are pathetic af and dont deserve recognition at all"
2,"As someone who has been very interested in neural networks for nearly a decade now, I can completely understand why people are hesitant to accept AI art. I feel like it would be a good idea to put Ina AI art in it's own separate tag."
2,Ina draws any NSFW? She commissions?! Oh god please!
2,Has she asked consent from all the people's art she used to learn how to make art herself?
2,"I don't find a f. I will post what I want with the tag. Gonna post nsfw AI art, how does that taste?"
2,there are tons of human artists that willing to get their works used by AI software to train it. instead the developer choose to take anything from danbooru without thinking future consequences
2,"Honestly people need to chill with the nsfw art, she wanted to keep the hashtag SFW EVER SINCE DEBUT, but i guess people that post nsfw don't watch Ina anyway..."
1,so cute 🥰😍
1,"Agree with her 100%.
And to add, Ai art has no intent. Its value is very low."
2,"I hope that AI art just gets segregated from man-made art. All this AI art is just making me pessimistic about the future of art.😵 I can just imagine it swallowing the art industry as a whole, with people not having any motivation to draw and even learn how to draw because ""what's the point?"". When AI art can just draw for us anyway, when even if you do get good your art's just gonna be food for AI lol, when even if you do develop your own style AI can just copy it easy-peasy, imagine the years you spent learning anatomy, colors and shapes and you just get dunked on by amateurs putting descriptions in an AI's mouth to make it shit out masterpieces.

Why even learn art? Why even do art? Why fight, it's no use fighting against robots😵. 

Maybe NFT will save art? IIRC, it uses those blockchain stuff that act like keys. Maybe it'll protect future artists? Or is this just precisely the plans of big heads?

IDK, f*ck this ted talk🤣"
1,When your beloved priestess has wise words to say regarding all topics....
0,"AI art is a very dangerous proposition to the art ecosystem in and outside of the internet. 

I guess the simple fact that the AI was trained using thousands of existing art pieces drawn by other artists without their consent, makes it a huge moral quandary to tackle. 

It's like someone put a camera in your work place and then a few years later says ""you're fired, we had a robot watch everything you do until it was trained to do your job"", but it's even worse than that since artists mostly work freelance so that means their work has become a data base to replace them. 

I mean this brings us back to how much of your art do you actually own? Is simply viewing your art that you yourself put out there should be illegal without consent? And are you okay if someone else uses your art to learn how to trace and paint the same way you did to improve their skill a bad thing? 

I guess we have finally hit the stage in humanity's advance where we have to clearly specify where the line between Human and AI exists, and this frightens me a little to be honest."
0,Not surprised but still disappointed by her take on ai art.
1,"I love saying the name Ina, very addicting word to say, ina"
1,"wooohoo.. finally, an illustrator said it. F8ck AI art. it's just a mash up of unoriginal things."
1,"tbh, an official lewd hashtag for her would be great for...reasons ~"
2,"What i've seen so far, they're not 100% perfect yet, especially when drawing anatomy, sometimes you'd see mutants 2 out of 10. And some of them feels to samey, too similar color scheme despite different characters or objects. I followed abubu on pixiv, and he creates quite good AI arts, but make no mistake; he is already an illustrator/artist, knows anatomy/style/compositions/storyboard (that Japari Park meet SCP-like story? It's his) and he trained the AI using his own arts and style."
2,"As a programmer, there is another thing to think about. If you ask an AI for a picture of Ina, it will not (at least if it's any  ofthe well-known ones) just photoshop pictures from its database together (that'd be indeed a pretty bad creative rights infringement), it would create it from scratch based on their ""idea"" of what ""Ina"" is. Where did it get the idea of what ""Ina"" is? From the same place we all did - from looking at all the pretty art of her, both official and fanart. Sure, the AI needs a lot more art as its input than a human, because it's dumb (for now), but the internal process is the same. An AI transforms the art it sees into the internal representation, which isn't just a copy of the art, and more like abstract ""idea"", and then creates art based on that idea. Human artists do the same thing, they're just better at it since they need much less input to draw something, but they still need it. Think of all the art that you've seen in your entire life, all the art you've used as references while training, and never asked for a permission about it. So... can we really say that AI art is not okay because we didn't ask for permission from artists we took art from for training, if human artists do the same thing, just on a smaller scale and throughout their entire life?

I do agree with Ina on the art tag decision though. As someone in another comment said, art is more than just a pretty picture, and fanart is meant for people to express themselves, while AI expresses nothing, even if it manages to make a picture prettier than some of the fanarts. I do think, however, that there is a place for AI art, it's just not here"
0,"i tried it...and its meh, it didnt deliver the one that im looking for specifically"
2,Haha if ai art is normal we wont have unique art anymore
2,"There's definitely a copyright and ethics issue in there since AI in its current incarnation is trained on other people's art. I think AI art will eventually be considered a different form of media from a legal and social perspective and be handled differently, just like how digital art and photography are considered different from traditional art forms like sketching and oil painting despite all of them being artistic endeavours. 

As a parallel, there are several nuances involved in architectural photography. Commercial use of the photos requires permission from the architect, builder etc, but members of public can take personal photos without obtaining permission under certain conditions, like the building being a public place. Similarly, the best practices around AI art will eventually be codified and AI art makers may eventually be recognised as legitimate artists. But in the meantime, it's most sensible to respect the wishes of the artists whose works are at risk of being cannibalised by AI art generators."
2,"I see AI art in a similar vein to photorealistic art (Not my cup of tea, but I have mad respect for artists whom can produce it). Some of the more prominent photorealism artists will take many photos of a subject and then draw a picture that combines elements of each of the photos to create a new ""Ideal"" picture of the subject. The ideal picture often being replicable by... Just taking a good photo with a camera (And yes, these artists still are in business even though cameras exist which can ""Do their job"" faster and easier).

AI art does something similar, where the AI learns from art about a subject, then creates a new image based on parameters put in. The end result is still something new, rather than a copy of the source materials, it will just have a similar style as the references (Which is my main issue with AI art as art, you don't get the unique style that a human artist can end up creating which is something I really like from fanart. Mind you, not all human art has a unique style)

As far as AI art in an official art tag goes... Part of it comes down to whether the art tag is supposed to highlight talented artists, or highlight people's adoration of their oshi. With of course the concern that due to the speed at which AI art can be created compared to human art there can be ""Spam"" of AI art that obfuscates human art (Of course all issues with this could be alleviated with a dedicated AI art tag I guess)

Regarding people's concerns that AI art will put human artists out of work in the future... I don't think that's the case. Much like how cameras haven't put photorealism artists out of a job but instead created a new subcategory of artists known as photographers (Whom are able to use camera positioning, filters, timing etc. To make high quality photos). Most likely there will simply be some professional AI artists that work on curating the source art and parameter definitions to create art that more accurately fits what they imagine. Not to mention the fact that since AI art relies upon source artwork, people still need to be creating that source artwork (As I doubt that AI would learn as much from looking at its own work)"
0,"If they use dataset from copyright free website then it wouldn't be a problem, but they basically use it on website with repost and stolen art and have the gall to monetize their product."
0,"if a person exclusively uses AI to generate ""art"" without any extra steps, they are not artists, they are thieves. nothing more, probably less"
2,"I agree that the art tag is not the place for AI art, and that the ethics of training on others art is questionable (though it seems closer to 'inspiration' than 'copying'). Certainly, there is inherent value to the skill and techniques required to create something from scratch, like the difference between painting and photography. However, in my opinion AI art is just another tool in the artist's toolbox. An AI generated artwork isn't really a finished piece of work on its own. It can be a good starting point, but editing, redrawing and improving on its mistakes is still required if you want a really good piece of art. Another good use for it is in ideation, concept generation. In the end, art requires a person to give it meaning, both in terms of its creation, where an artist determines what should be conveyed and how that should be achieved, what improvements to make, and in terms of the viewer, who appreciates and interprets it."
1,"As an artist myself, I don’t mind the AI art, it’s like how back then when the Camera was first invented, it was thought that artists would all lose their jobs. But the camera is just another tool for art. AI art could be revolutionary, ie filling in the inbetweens of key frames in animation or drawing a background so you can focus on the foreground. We are just one step close to being able to print what we visual in our heads."
0,"Love how most comments here are focused on the ai aspect. But ignore the NSFW one, seems a lot of artists are given an inch, and take a mile when it comes to posting lewd stuff in the official tags. (p.s. ai art is a fools tool, and deserves the least respect imaginable)."
0,"Kinda baffles me that out of all of HoloMyth, Ame is the one that actively encourages AI art. She made fun of NFTs with that one stream she did, but for some reason she's cool with AI art anyway, which is just another grift by crypto bros now that they see NFTs falling. Was honestly disappointed by her stance. Yeah people are creating AI art and you can't stop them from making it, but that's not even the point and Ame missed on that front. Fan art tags are to showcase people's hard work and their art of their favorite streamer. People just typing words into a machine and having them say ""I mADe tHiS 🤓"" when they actually didn't defeats the whole point of an art tag and takes away from those who actually put in work. At best, and I'm even being nice about this, AI art should just be used as a reference when making an actual drawing. It shouldn't be taken as is and posted on Twitter claiming you drew it when you didn't. Glad to see Ina and the others see it this way, but extremely disappointed with Ame stance. I just hope Ame doesn't use AI art from her hashtag as thumbnails in the future because then that's when this becomes a serious problem. Still love her though, just disappointed 😔"
1,Bless the 4th wah 🙏
2,I see people who post AI art are just people who want an easy way of being noticed by their oshi. It's not okay. AI art is cool to look at but sharing it is weird. I get it's not going away but Ina being an actual artist saying it's not really okay should say alot.
2,Just call the AI art as InAInART or something like that
1,Tentai was actually hilarious in the chat
0,God she sounds so tired. I hope she will rest well on her break
2,Give us NSFW tag and your tag will be family friendly. Why didn't she choose NSFW tag for years?
2,"I understand when ina think ai art will not stop because art actually right now looks like have so much potential for profit and that sadly will be helping many companies for their ""common art"" project rather search humans, faster, cheap and quality not that bad,,, it's kinda like we as artist learn many years for the 1 technique or style to make it perfect and ai can just make art in any style and technique under an hour although they say they make it needs so much effort too you know that not fair,, it's sad, what I do now just improving my skill in animation and making the style that ai can't copy it for safe my work from ai"
2,"I don't watch Ina's streams as much as I would like to (even though I consider myself a takodachi...), can someone explain the forbidden wah/4th wah thing to me? I'm guessing it has something to do with ""the fourth wall"" but I can't figure out how that relates to lewd art."
2,I wish she'd make a nsfw hashtag would just make things easier for everyone.
0,"ina ;(, i hope you okay. You sound stresses"
1,Shoutout to the mofo that suggested PINAS as the nsfw art tag
1,"I'm gonna agree on the consent perspective... As a programmer, this is a leap in artificial intelligence and is interesting from that angle; as an art fan, I understand intently that just because someone puts something online, that creator hasn't surrendered their copyright or license over the work.

So, if the training models used art with consent, I probably wouldn't have a problem with it. I know how hard it is to ask permission in gathering so much data to bring value quickly, but that's kinda the point. It's not just data for the taking."
2,"AI art is like cheats/hacks in a video game.
It's essentially no different, both take away the effort and skill in learning how to improve as a script/3rd party software completely does everything and eliminates all perceived effort."
0,"AI is already drawing and playing videogames for us, but a robot that could make me a sammich is still outside of the realm of possibility. 
The worst timeline. When I come to power, people who create Abominable Intelligence will be turned into toilet cleaning servitors"
2,keep it family friendly? what does she mean? my family loves orgies :)
2,"Im a ok with A.I. generator in the sense of development advance (tech are cool, programming is hard,i died), but not the way it was used by 'A.I prompters' who dont even code to resell it. 

My personal opinion: 
if the DEVS want to profit from the use of A.I. generator, they can but they need to make sure the A.I are trained with consented arts, also need to advise the users to just use the generated art for personal use, not to be resold . Free arts online isn't meant to be taken for reselling, its to showcase the artist skill"
1,"Ina put it very nicely, ai art usually borrows without consent of others people’s works.
To me, its not real art if you cant make your own and it is clear the Ai dosent have that concept.
Funny enough Ai art can make “modern art” or art ranging from 2022-1890 but hasnt been developed enough for more complicated art works like da vinci. This is not to be confused with being able to make a painting similar to that style. Its rare to master a painting or style, so much more has to be done instead of just the act of drawing, painting, etc.
So much more that ai has to consider before applying"
2,"Personally I don't want to see AI art on her art tag but I don't mind seeing AI art on my bird app feed, but they should atleast put a tag that it is an AI art. Im willing to accept AI art as an art but what annoys me about AI art are the ones who are posting it and claiming it as their own then calling themselves as an artist"
1,"As cool and interesting AI art is, she has a point. It completely devalues the time and effort actual artists have put into perfecting their skills. It's much the same as the old ""payment by exposure"" for musicians."
2,"This is what you get for pirating Photoshop.

jk jk"
2,"While the tech is cool, the problem is that it kinda reduces art to just the final product rather than the process. A lot of charm comes from the skill and the emotions that go into it; seeing an image from the artists imagination and feelings take form with the abilities they have. If you're just into seeing an image for instant gratification, AI can do it, but nothing beyond that."
2,I understand her on NSFW. Like it's fine to make those and shouldn't feel discouraged to post any. But the streamer won't be on your side liking them. It's fine but don't expect her using them unless it's an batsu
1,Ina is such a good girl. <3
2,"My friend is a programmer while I'm an artist myself. We argued about AI art that we reached a fair conclusion where we saw eye-to-eye on the matter. 
The concept of AI art is outstanding and should be kept as an advancement of technology, BUT the process of using a database of material that's most likely stolen to begin with, and/or the users behind the works themselves are what's the problem. The people are given a tool much like any other, but only the terrible ones would abuse it. Ina is right on the matter where she's ""mostly"" against it.

If anyone doesn't know, a famous Korean illustrator, Kim Jung Gi, recently passed away. Someone already went ahead and trained an AI to copy his works and draw like him. What does this mean? Your works will be used without your consent after you die. This is what companies have been looking for all these years because art is one of the few things they couldn't automate until now. 
I've been recently playing Cyberpunk 2077 because of the anime, and I came across a clothing shop where the registrar was complaining that he was a fashion designer and that he used to own the store. I asked him what happened? A machine took over his job because it can put out a hundred designs in a second, and that was something he couldn't compete with. This is the future we're probably headed to.

There needs to be a law that protects the rights of these artists, otherwise, the industry will just off itself by mutually assured destruction."
1,"For an artist like Ina I understand 100% what she feel about AI art.
So I just hope the takodachis around will respect her choice."
2,"Being someone who started learning digital art two months ago, I do understand both sides of the coin. It’s terribly frustrating to see AI generates good quality artwork in a few seconds and it kind of demotivates me from working harder in art. On the other side, AI art is a convenient tool for self-taught artists to learn the basics like color selection, body posture, composition, etc."
1,"Absolutely understandable in both statements, I agree with her. AI art is pretty fascinating but using it as a way to create actual art and label it as your ""own"" is not only lazy but pretty scummy, even more if people are using it to make profit."
2,is it really that hard to make an AI art tag to put the AI art in?
0,"now that AI art has been refined to what it can create NOW, along with deepfakes, its a pandora's box that we will never be able to close, we just have to prepare ourselves for the coming hellish dystopia"
1,"I think what a lot of people are missing is there's more to art than the pretty picture that comes out at the end.  It's like if someone bakes you a cake from scratch rather than buying a pre-made one from a store.  Sure, they followed a recipe, and they're both cakes, they may even be identical cakes, but you understand that you attach a higher emotional value to one over the other.
The fanart tags are, in spirit, meant to be a showcase for people who have put in that hard work and discipline, it's not simply just a place where pretty pictures go.  I'd agree that AI art has no place there."
2,"I want someone way smarter than me to make an AI to detect AI art, cuz that thing is starting to get annoying"
2,It's such a gray area about the training of the AI using a public database cuzz artist want to show their art but now it can be used to gen more art like theirs at a faster pace but the only way to prevent it is to not post it anywhere public but then what's the point in even making sed art its quite the conundrum. The gate of hell will truly open when ai starts learning out of not only 1 site but also from Twitter and other public sites where tons of art gets posted.
2,"Since the back incident, the takos were out of control for a long time and her nsfw art skyrocketed. So its nice to keep it in check now. Since the art tag its kinda a reflect of the character that is getting tagged."
2,"Guys, what is the forbidden wah? Asking out of curiosity and not because I'm an undercover investigative journalist."
2,common ina W
2,"Ina: ""Some people shouldn't see not safe for work yet, lets keep it family friendly""

Takodachis: ""B-But what about your back?"""
2,"AI's output is from human's art input
So is this inspiration or just imitation?
Dunno, AI is weird
I prefer AIna"
1,Ina is an Artist so i understand how she feel about AI art using your drawing to make other drawing without asking permission from the artist
0,"It's sad but it is pretty much inevitable, the same with robot taking jobs out of people, IA does not have feelings and doesn't need rest eventually there will be more AI art than original art if it isn't already the case."
2,"Regarding the AI art thing, I've never heard of a human creating good art without having artistic references from the environment around them either, including other works of art. And a lot of what these things spit out is not very good."
2,"The one guy who suggested ""Pinas"" as nsfw art tag"
2,"I'm not on the level that can call myself an artist but I'm also don't think using AI art is good, I mean yes art is a thing that you collect experience style of other artist to develope your own style but The AI just do the first part and completely ignore the develop your style stuffs, and also after some random guy make an AI to draw ""Like Kim Jung Gi"" 2 days after he die, I'm completely on the side of people who hate AI art."
0,"I like how she without much of a thought used the word ""mostly"", almost hinting that she understands the issue on a developer level."
1,"Honestly, I agree with Ina on both fronts."
2,"Wait, if you are the card game master... Why have you never played clash royale?"

0,How is it fun? It’s rather boring.
2,"I mean, or not"
2,I am playing already
2,I tried it too and honestly thought everyone I was playing against were bots

2,MORE MARVEL SNAP
2,One step closer to being a Shang Chi extra.
2,I created a destroy and discard apocalypse deck i call DND first few days i downloaded the game. Turns out Discard Apocalypse is meta

1,Those paid actors that played against Toast are really good at their work.
1,omg thanks toast for showing me this game
2,I'm pretty addicted to this game. But was from the last video that showed it off.
0,"I wanted to like this game, but unlike games such as Legends of Runeterra or even Hearthstone at some point you just hit a progress cap where you need to spend real world money get anything new and that's just unfun."
2,It wired you don't play LOR.
0,I gave up I literally uploaded about 100 marvel snap videos got 2 views at most in each and just deleted them all
0,"too bad , i can only do like 3 games a day , because u run out of upgrade materials after a few days.
typical mobile moneygrab"

2,It's kinda like MTG and Poker had a baby that was really into Marvel.

0,Your videos have been so much less entertaining. You are too cocky and I use to watch you all the time. You have changed. In my mind not for the better but for the worst. You think we will stick around for whatever you do but your attitude has changed so much and I do not like it. I am unsubscribing today. Best of luck to you toast. I still wish the best but wanted to give my reasons for not watching you anymore.  I hope you go back to the old you so I can subscribe and watch you every day again. Love your old stuff bro. Best of luck in your new adventures!
2,One location gave me a random card that plays cards for me against my will until it was placed sadly it was a 5 cost card so I got to play on turn 6
0,I almost didn't watch this because of youtube ads
1,"I played this before I went to bed and boy each game is 5 ins, but I forgot and play 10 in a row, a very fun game"

1,Toast’s haircut really making this feel more nostalgic.
1,"i did play the game during the bate and must say its extremly enjoyable.
the games are very short but each game stays refreshing and interesting. which is absolutly incredible on how they designed it that way

the snap mechanic that ads a meta element that doesnt effect the game itself at all and only the ""Mind"" of the players is a absolutly great addition that changed my view on how ranking should work in competetive games and that they may be way more ways to improve them from what we have right now in most games

Some Problems i have with the Game are in the comments to this comment."

1,This for whatever reason was one of the funniest videos from Ludwig
0,Moral of the story: Don't be ugly or fat and you stand a chance. Ive learned nothing new.
2,"I mean, fair."
0,With the new YouTube layout Ludwig's name is just L
2,this guy REALLY sounds like Savix
1,Everyone saying no in the chat looll
2,Donovan would've been really hot if he worked on his double chin
0,It is absolutely criminal that Cody Ko is not mentioned anywhere here.
0,"I loved my school bus drivers growing up, and then like 2 of them were pedos"
2,Thought this was another Cody Co video
1,respect to the guy who put bromance before that girl. absolute chad behaviour
0,"I don’t like the title, he probably got nothing against bigger people and I don’t think anyone should but that doesn’t mean I don’t have preferred body type tf"
1,Nathan is the GOAT! Homie don’t like fat bitches and that’s valid
0,"Hey Ludwig, sorry chat made you have a stressful stream"
2,can't lie this don't hit like cody ko haha
0,The producers made the video so much worse than it had to be lmao.
1,gigachad
0,Imagine how fucked up it'd be if he pressed the button after they agreed to go on a date 💀
1,Asian guy is a legend
2,why is it filmed with the porno up close and personal sound effects? i feel so many different ways right now
0,"the producers are fucked tho, because they saw what he was doing, and kept throwing out big girls"
0,"I'm sorry, but if you're resorting to manipulative tactics because you can't be upfront enough to say what you want or don't want, then it wasn't the women's loss at all that he buzzed them out, this dude will be a nightmare to date if this is how he 'works' women"
1,"They both reach out to touch the button, but in that moment where their hands meet: sparks fly."
1,"I used to ride 7 school buses a day and the bus drivers were usually like a parent, one of them we even called mom. The one driver I had for like 6 years until I drove myself to school, one let me break dumb rules she had cause the other kids were awful, one told me what it felt like to get a tattoo since I was about to get one (a couple weeks from turning 18), one consulted me since I had to go to school while my mom took my favorite cat that day to be put down and I still cry thinking about it, one would always play the men's room which was a funny radio talk show, one would always give random cool facts, and one would show us cool drawings he would do in his free time. School bus drivers are dope"
0,Bruh she started saying “I’m sorry” before pressing the button I woulda snapped on that shit before she pressed it.
0,"Can we please talk about the fact that the weeb girl openly stated she prefers Asian men? If a male came through and pulled that shit he'd be decimated on twitter for objectifying and fetishising Asian women before he even finished the shoot lmfao
(edit: oop I should probably just watch videos through without pausing to comment lol)"
1,Buttoning the morbidly obese is a W from me dawg
1,make this a series!
1,"Aside from wanting to date someone almost half their age, Craig is pretty cool."
0,"This show proved without a shred of doubt, Speed Dating is Shallow. Great for hookups, nothing more."
2,Show should be renamed to how fast are your reflexes
0,"Okay, nah. These women were shallow. Lud's hating on the guy for checking their size, but that woman in the black shirt literally first question she asked was how tall he is. And then she had the audacity to ask if the guy just doesn't make enough money to want 3 kids? Bro, she's shallow incarnate."
2,Lud you can tell if someone works out just by feeling if their hands are callused
1,Plsssssssss wathc more of this is so funnyyýyyyyyyyyyy

0,"cody back on his bullshi- wait, this is ludwig?"
0,This video would have been too cringe to watch without your reactions tbh. One of the few times I think reactions actually add to the video
1,Would have done the same thing as the guy like hug test baby
0,"That first interaction highlighted everything wrong with our generation.
Mike Rowe really said it best. We've ostracized our hard workers that don't have college degrees for no reason than the perpetuate the college debt profits. Blue Collar workers make this country work, and yet we treat them like they should be ashamed of what they do."
1,Bros really taking one for the team getting all the fat girls out.

2,Gut feeling that you're a huuuuuuuuge bi-
1,THE CHAT IS SO FUNNY
2,I mean i don't blame the guy for not wanting to enter into a relationship w someone he's not physically attracted to. Or entertain fake interest for a studio date when he knows in actuality he would never go out with someone that doesnt meet his standards
0,The moment she said im glad i skip the other dude before him is a sign just fck her and leave dont invest too much because she will leave him 100% if she find a better looking one 😂😂😂
0,nah Lud got it wrong its better when they take the blindfold off its so much more drama
0,"the whole school bus thing is facts, school bus drivers are so impactful. my first school bus driver was great. Second one? he was terrible. He yelled at everyone a lot, and missed peoples stops sometimes. I remember one time he stopped the bus because everyone was “too loud” and forced kids to day bible verses like??? not everyone is christian. smh"
1,Lmaooo the dude hugging to feel if the girls were fat is insane and instantly push the button like at least be less obvious 😭😭😭

1,He valid for that
2,"Cut is in Seattle, and if you dont know, in Seattle we whats called the Seattle Freeze, where people who interact for the first time kind of dont always vibe well, like almost never unless forced to, in which if its forced, Somtimes you may make friends

2,maybe I'm just a bad person but is it not a valid reason to buzz if they aren't your body type? like that's personal preference no?
2,Is it really fatphobic to have a type?
0,This show is just horrible. Just confirms that looks are important 😂
0,12:52 that shirt is terrible. It's a blouse that is cut under her chest so her belly is exposed and the back is just 2 strings that you tie like a bikini.  Terrible.
2,three is the perfect amount of kids
1,The third guy was a chad
2,"""Gut Feeling"" Nah he just felt her gut when they hugged"
2,"""im into older guys"" 

> only dates 22-30, not even old

1,Low key... he had the strat though
2,"""gut feeling"" wasn't a lie, he felt the size of her gut, it was too big, lol."
2,"whats wrong with this? a HUGE part of a relationship is physical appearance, if im not attracted to someone physically im not going to date them"
2,This guy is about it
2,Dude a school bus driver? And you pass? Like what more do you want?
0,i have actually never felt so much pain in watching a video. I was forced to cringe physically for the first time somehow. Incredible
0,Ludwig thinking she was talking about cum is CRAZY😂

1,The only car crash I’ve been in was my school bus driver smoking the back of a car. My face smacked the front of the seat so hard haha
1,Nathan was a king honestly
0,bro chat was not into it during the opener 💀
1,"Loving this new incredibly original content, maybe Cody ko should try this"
1,Nathan bro just own up to it lol.
2,"Another problem with this show is that they are able to confer with the girls/boys in the backstage before and after, spoiling the point of the blindfolds and the show in general by putting in pre-conceived notions about the person that rejected the person before them. There's so much wrong with this show, it is entertaining but annoying as hell."
2,"""I don't see it. I think they both could do better.""  -- Dwight Schrute"

1,Absolute 5head plays by my guy Nathan
1,Ludwig is so effortlessly cool
1,"At this point I'm starting to think it may just be fuckin better to stay single. All these people ONLY caring about looks EVEN IN A BLINDFOLDED SITUATION LMFAO.
Why would you accept the chance to be a part of this - knowing you're gonna be blindfolded - if looks are that important to you.... 

Major YIKES for these people."
2,"""just for the experience"" says the chrimson chin"

0,"That's why I fucking hate flirting, just to get rejected like that"
2,My guy has a real strat and it's disguised enough to work just before they catch on.
1,That like button is looking real sexy! 😘
2,"People are talking down on people being superficial on this show but it’s entertainment lol. Being shallow and rejecting someone cause they’re ugly is going to rack up more views, plus who’s actually trying to look for a genuine connection while appearing on a show like this? More likely they’re trying to get more on-screen experience to audition for bigger shows."
1,bro got that dawg in him
0,This is insufferable to watch besides having Ludwig be the voice of cringe

2,Ludwig back to original content. Mogul Mail should definitely learn from him
2,This show would literally be fixed if the person that clicks the button is the one that leaves. Change that and it suddenly becomes interesting.
1,I love craig
2,AAAAAa
2,That last guy got rizz😂
0,This isn't a dating game; this is trying to figure out if the other person is ugly.
1,As a fat person I’d like to say it’s totally okay to make fun of fat people bc it is our choice and and most of us laugh about it too
0,hardest thing ive ever watched

0,Cringe level off the charts lmao
2,9:52 hasan type scream lol
2,Ludwig is trying to be cody ko now xD
2,Nobody owes you love. You are not owed love. If someone does not love you for a specific characteristic it is entirely in their right not to love you for it.
2,they definitely put the big girls first on purpose
2,ripping cody’s content…. okay i see you
1,The hugger dude is a king I’m laughing my fuckin ass off😂😂

(ALSO TYSM FOR 70K VIEWS 😭😭😭💘💘💘, i made this out of boredom and didn't expect to blow up DKWED)"
2,If you start digging into the past I think you're going to find a lot more that match.
2,What do you mean by ''two''?
2,What music video is this from?
2,Pretty sure the treasure song uses the Baby I’m yours song by breakbot as a foundation. Triple threaaaat
2,I was mentally repairing myself for a Rick Roll 😂
2,"As someone who knows neither song



This is good"
2,"what's funny is the first song is called moonlight and from the same bruno mars album as treasure, there's a song called moonshine"
2,whoever that second group is needs to stop copying TWICE 🙄
2,"Do you know how many modern songs steal/sample old school beats? I can prolly find an old song for most ""hits"" these days.🙈"
2,Those funky basslines sound almost identical too.
2,Lol I thought it was gonna be psychosocial
2,"Don't worry bro, I don't know who TF were those girl!
I know bruno Mars tho♡"
1,I dare someone to make a mashup
2,these are hella similar
2,"LITERALLY just hearing the first song and went ""hmmmmm this is familiar"" TREASURE WAS THE EXACT SONG I WAS THINKING"
1,I desperately need a full version 🙏
2,Treasure was exactly the first thing that came to mind when I first listened to Moonlight😭 Oftentimes I expect the pre chorus of Moonlight to be followed by Treasure as the chorus
2,You can also transition Bruno Mar's Treasure to Michael Jackson's Rock With You. They also have the same BPM
1,So satisfying omg
2,"bro i thought it was gonna transition to a rickroll, sounds abt right"
2,even the bass line is very similar
1,I'd be willing to hear a full mashup of these songs
2,One of Twice's dream is to have a collab with Bruno Mars
0,Wouldn’t be the first time a manufactured  Kpop group just outright stole something
2,I dont even know that first song

Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. (James 4:4)
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30)"
1,Need to make a full length mash up.
2,Both songs share a producer! Which is why it's so similar
0,Both shitty
2,Isn't it similar to the one sunny

2,Uncultured me : they are same song
2,"I searched for the first song name with the Shazam app, and it told me that was Treasure by Bruno Mars 😄"
2,For some reason I was thinking of because of you from Ne-yo
2,You should do a three-way comparison since Treasure also borrowed the beat and rhythm from Breakbot
2,Also key and akin instrumentation.
2,Please why did I hear Plastic Love 😭😭
2,Same key too lmao
2,Well BPM and key is pretty much the only thing you need to mix 2 Songs together... Thats the trick how DJs manage to mix the Songs so smoothly
0,the bloody card spoiled it
1,"Please someone make a mashup, this is so good I might cry from joy"
0,"You know I usually go out of my way to hate any and all kpop music I hear, but that’s not too bad"
0,Woah 2 pop songs sound the same?! MIND BLOWN
2,Now the question we must all ask ourselves: which is better?
2,and the same key too? no wonder I thought of bruno mars instantly!
1,Loved it
2,Probably the first one of these I've seen that wasn't cursed.
0,Bruno mar’s face is so irritating.
2,"A little trivia for you all: Treasure was technically a rip-off of Baby I’m Yours by Breakbot, but since Breakbot himself didn’t wanna press any charges, they just said Treasure sampled Baby I’m Yours and moved on."
2,clicked for kim dahyun
1,Ok!
1,Wow
2,is that TWICE? is that sana? Minatozaki Sana? MINATOZAKI????????? SANA????????? SANA-SAN????????????????????????????????????? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2,"My ears stink so I’m probably wrong but the only part of the beat that sounded familiar between both songs what the transition part. Imo they had two different tempos like they hardly sounded similar. 

Then again I’m no musical pro and I have the ears of an 80 year old so iono 🤷‍♂️"
1,God bless everyone and have a good day.
2,Maybe Twice sampled the music from Bruno Mars.
0,Damn it
0,So wtf?
0,This is a really bad one of these. These songs are so similar that there's no comedy derived from the juxtaposition. Compare it to the golde standard - the one that compares All About That Base to Death Grips. That one still makes me laugh even 7 years later.
2,can't unsee the two spiderman spanking each other as treasure's beat comes in
1,I love how a generic mark can make such a great transition
2,I was waiting for being rickrolled... So... Now i feel completly empty

1,We need a mashup
2,deadass thought this was the real song bc i've never heard the original LMAO
1,they're rly similar songs! also i'm so glad this wasn't a rickroll
2,No wonder it sounded familiar 😳
2,"same bpm, same key, same style, same drums, same melody... basically just the singers are different"
2,They are even in the same key lol
2,you got me there
2,this is more than just a BPM its like a total duplicate of the instrumental.

2,"I mean, Breakbot did it earlier, but more funk is always good."
2,huge plagiat
2,plagy
2,No rickroll?
2,"this sounds like the ""ladies and gentlemen we got him"" meme listen baby. your wish is my command"
2,and the same key
2,pov: you came for the cute asian girl in the thumbnail
2,"The ""1,2,3,4,5"" is iconic"

Tempo: 116 BPM
Key: F Minor
Time signature: 4/4

Bruno Mars - Treasure
Tempo: 116 BPM
Key: F Minor
Time signature: 4/4

2,and the same key if I'm not mistaken
2,"i was thinking of treasure when listening to the first half, then treasure suddenly appears"
2,same bmp and in the same key!! 😍🙌🏼

2,"My lungs were so ready to scream ""you and i dancin in the moonlight"" and forgot this was a comparison video👁️👄👁️"
2,I thought it was the your wish is my command song
2,Tbh that first song sounds like it’s ripping off treasure
2,this transition>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
2,I thought it would be a rickroll
1,I guess we can say that transition was an absolute treasure
2,"The .Paak and Bruno's song is awfully reminiscent of ""Breakbot - Baby I'm Yours"""
2,this vid is how i found moonlight like forever ago aahh
2,Where's the second song?
0,Who fucking cares
2,"not just bpm, but the melody is similar too"

1,Omg!
1,OMG
1,"i love this, this is so cute"
2,The first song also made me think of Plastic Love
1,twice and Bruno Mars = perfection
1,Moonlight is lowkey the best song on that album and quite possibly one of Twice's best songs period.
2,not to mention the exact same vibe and instruments
2,DOUBLE QUARTERH POUNDEH WITH CHEESE !!!!
2,"i mean judging by the bpm, key, and chord progressions, bruno's song must be the sample so...🥴"

1,nah this goes way too hard...
1,This is so good!!!
1,This got me of guard lol!
2,"Considering ""Treasure"" is nine (NINE!) years older than this song, it's probably more accurate to say that ""Moonlight"" is simply a Bruno Mars song written for Twice."

1,So good
1,Nice transition
1,lmfao unironically one of the smoother transitions in this site nice

America needs to reflect on what principles actually made it great in the first place. It needs to rediscover and implement these principles that will really -
Make America Great Again.

CIA/MI6 etc. EU countries are aware of it, so is Australia & Canada, but go along with it, for their own economic, political and security reasons. Together, they call themselves the ""international community"". US & UK imperialism & modern colonialism are very much alive and kicking. Russia is now simply pushing NATO away. US & UK are using NATO, just like they have used Ukraine as a doormat, to encircle Russia at its borders.

1,"Intel seems to be quite cost effective, They just need to manage manage a GPU that can stack up to a 3080 efficiently, and I'd get on in a heart beat. I already have an older GPU that performs better minus the ray tracing, so something that can  do better with the ray tracing is all I just need as an upgrade. especially if it's about 350usd, that's a huge deal.Maybe when Intel makes their 2nd Gen, they'll  compete with the upper mid-tier lineup on these cards.

Here's  to hoping, and preventing price gauging."

2,So if I buy this should I go for ryzen 5 or 7 (7000)
2,"The biggest issue with intel arc gpus is they're aiming at a market not suited for a first gen card. Late into the main gen cycle for amd and nvidia they're now arguably the best budget option, but people today building a budget pc are first time builders who shouldn't trust the unreliable drivers and stuff, or people upgrading from much older systems who probably dont care as much about intricacies of new tech and just want something cost effective that works well."
0,I own a 3060 and I feel personally attacked

2,"Would have been pretty funny if he said on 1:10 ""exited to tell you about our new sponsor right now: INTEL!"""
2,"See, I'm not sure the Linux support setup is actually a dealbreaker. Many Linux gamers (in the tiny market of Linux gamers that exist) already run on Arch, which will deliver 6.0 hot off the presses. Meanwhile, a lot of the issues around Arc are either mitigated or just a problem anyways. We don't have to worry about taking the hit on Intel's DX12 translation, because we do DX to Vulkan translation already anyways and take the hit for it on every vendor. But also, our old games use OpenGL, and the Iris OpenGL driver is in relatively good shape, or so I hear. 

So with everything looking the way it is, it's very possible that Arc is actually going to be a solid option for Linux gamers. Although I haven't checked Phoronix's analysis in detail yet."

1,I kinda wanna get one of these and build  fairly minimalist gaming system to test my code on and let my family and friends game on it (they can't touch my development machines lol).

Guess it is simpler going with AMD rt 6800 xt and just wait it out till a new amd cpu and mobo will be needed."

2,I wonder how arc performs using DXVK [FOSS d3d9/10/11-> Vulkan] instead of the microsoft d3d9->12 translator?
0,If we buy these now all that tells Intel is that we are willing to buy a substandard product and then they'll release another one next thing you know its just another dynasty of stagnating products
0,"Surprisingly terrible advice by Linus. The only people who should buy ARC are people playing only dx12 games (or have a narrow use case) or those well enough off wanting to experiment. Everyone else should buy an nvidia or amd product that meets their needs.

I very much doubt Linus will be heeding his own words here."

2,"Actually, I had BIG hopes for the Intel graphics cards.

""Hey, finally something new is coming! 🙂""

But the performance is just too bad for games. I don't do video editing where I have to render 40 Gb, also I do very little photo editing. (I'm all out when it comes to mining). My focus is more on gaming. And yes, I play a lot of CS GO with my friends, and I can't use low FPS there.
When Intel is as far as Nvidia, you can consider buying an Intel card, but not like this. No matter if they only cost half now"
2,"Red, Green, Blue"
0,"We cant just give away our money , especially in times like this.
Why would anyone buy the Arc A770 when just so few games actually work for it.

Its a budget card that does not work well with budget games it seems.
If the performance was actually better for 1080p/1440p and older games it would rly be worth considering. But currently it just feels that you are shooting your own foot by buying this GPU."
1,Honestly glad to see Intel entering the ring to give Nvidia and AMD some needed competition.
2,"Can you imagine an Intel $1,500, GPU’s performance…"
2,Can you run them in tandem (STI/Crossfire) and have both used in modern games? Because if you can't I'm not seeing much of a point to not spend ~$50 more and get a stronger card 🤷💯
2,Just buy AMD.
0,"Stopped watching after csgo results, srsly..."
0,"better to buy AMD, fuck intel and nvidia."
0,"Cant watch this, everything is buyed by intel here..."
2,"I fully expect the drivers to improve over time.   The issue is how long that will take.  Intel needs to put as many people on it as it can to make the process as fast as it can.   One thing to keep in mind is that while a 3rd GPU maker is great for gamers, competition wise,  Intel also jumped back into the dGPU market more so because of GPGPU/ML and nvidia pushing it's GPUs in servers which was hurting Intels Xeon business, on top of what AMD was doing.   Long story short, I don't see them leaving the GPU market anytime soon, even if this first gen hardly sells at all."
1,If I for some reason have enough to spend on a new GPU at any point I'll def look into one of these
2,"About Linux.. it's far from ideal indeed, but in contrast to windows, you can put the newer kernel in an older OS like Ubuntu 2204"
1,I'll take their entire stock if the next card doesn't have those problems. Intel supremacy!
1,Great video and you gave me a very good laugh in that intro Linus.
2,i know gaming is one thing to mark but what about graphics design and video editing?
2,"It would be beneficial to Intel to focus more on specific areas  that would payoff with time. Ray tracing for example. It's the future of real time rendering and if they can brand their GPUs as THE ray tracing GPUs, then they would be really happy with the future ahead. Given they can last long enough in this market, of course."
2,I don't have a 10th gen cpu. I have a 7700k
2,Wait ı'm so confused.. İs İt good or na?
0,"Lets see what Intel can actually do, until they show of some serious competiotion, Ill stay with Red. You shouldnt take stupid risks while building a PC, people dont have enough money to yeet 400$ out the window for wannabe competitor that cant even beat the lower last gen linup.. And considering UE5 is a thing now, these cards will be even less capable (I think) as UE5 is not easy on your GPU.

If you only want to play some CS and other games the card performes well at, thats fine, lucky for you, you found your dream GPU, and thats totally fine, If the card serves you well, thats amazing, but until Intel prooves they can seriously compeat with high end gaming GPUS, Im not going to touch any of their products again, Im not forgetting that Intel thinks that priced their CPUs at 32k while AMDs competitor Threadripper used to be at 500$ with similar performance.... I aint forgetting tha Intel"
2,I'd be interested to see how well they will support Linux Drivers.
2,Do you guys think it's worth it if you came from an NVIDIA 1660 GPU? Use cases are games and 3D software such as Blender.

1,"i dont care, intel gpu the best in the world isekai"

1,"As someone who knows next to nothing about computers and REALLY wants to get into PC gaming, I honestly don't mind being one of the first to buy this GPU if that means helping the rest of us thrive in the future.

The only problem is, I have no idea how to build my own PC and what to even do when it comes to that sadly."
2,Linus is this sponsored?
1,I really hope intel does well. The market needs more competition. The duopoly of amd and nvidia is terrible for us consumers.
2,Given that I'm going to be building a new PC for my wife in the coming months and I have a 3060 in my current build. I'm seriously considering giving her my card and buying a 770 for myself just to see how it goes
2,i feel like linus is intel fanboy when it comes down to it.
1,"Linus, I’m so glad you keep us living and learning new tech.  You bring a light to these segments.  Thank you!"
1,Compettition will bring prices down. I might get this Intel card.
2,"is it a good card for game development? what are the compatibility issues say with unity or ue, and how fast can intel resolve them? questions, questions, questions!"
0,"LINUS THEY LIED, ITS 329"
0,I don't consider Nvidia shitting the bed to be an adequate reason to saddle myself with a GPU that eats too much damn power.  2022 is a bust—bring on 2023.
1,I mean... this is a good start to pressure Nvidia and AMD to hopefully stop their stupidity in overpricing GPUs since they're the only ones controlling the market. Hopefully it won't be the case in the next few years when Intel fixes its DirectX compatibility issues. We can't really give sh*t to Intel since they're doing all us a favor by being the new potential competitor in this current Duopoly.

2,Guess who put some stocks on Intel?
2,So it's decent at AI? or just inference and no good at machine learning?
1,With intel clear linux out thire an intel GPU is difnetly a great Idea

0,Junk they are glued and taped together
2,"oh boy i cant wait till miners buy all this out  
and detroy them with water when their coin breaks"
1,Intel just beat Nvidia on your next genand people will buy it
1,"Honestly, I think that Intel has done a great job so far with their GPUs, though they're not as good as the competitors, at such a low price I'm pretty sure they beat out everyone, to be honest. Not to mention this was literally their first time making a stand-alone GPU, I think that there's a lot of promise in these new cards."
0,never be a beta tester for a multimillion company
0,I use a LOT of AI tasks on my machine I will definitely consider Intel GPU as a serious purchase.
2,Great all we need is a team Yellow and we truly will have complete RGB! The question is who will take up that mantle?
1,"honestly for a first generation is not bad, if they work diligently on drivers"
2,"Intel getting better but still not enough…. Personally i think they should have a dlss proposition and a 3060-3070 proposition for each line , like 4070 ish , 5070ish and price themself in the 500$ that would undercut all the xxx60-70 and amd rx … rhey dont have to compete with 3080/3090 to do well"
2,I think the uptake of the Intel ARC GPU will be slow due to the fact you need a pretty recent motherboard chipset. Many gamers like to update their GPU and maybe the CPU but keep their motherboard/ram etc.
1,"I love you guys. but you make it so easy to skip your ""sponsor ad"". I hope it's not bad for you. but I'm just saying."
0,no.

2,"Nivida were ready to drop price of 3050/3060 to match A750 if Intel A750 were to get popular. AMD were nervous how to react.

After reading this review, both NV and AMD can now relieve."
2,"I bought an ARC380 intel gpu.... At first it was very slow... But after some driver updates its steadily increasing.. I think they limited their hardware and is performing on a ''test bed'' of some sorts....
 I can see they are silently grabbing usage statistics from my PC, I allowed it of course... THey need the data to improve it right?"
2,Todd Howard commands thus: But can it run Skyrim
2,"Sounds to me like the problem is with Intel's strategy. When Tesla started challenging the entrenched auto industry, they didn't start with trying to mass produce an affordable sedan. They started with a high cost, low volume vehicle. Intel should have done something similar."
2,Now we have RGB
2,"Team Blue... hmm, we have an RGB now"
1,"I really dislike intel for their cpu bs, but... Thanks. You did a good job"
2,Intel is better than the 3060 period especially if running Intel or amd
2,Hmmm I'm wondering how much of a performance gain I would get If i swapped my EVGA 3060 XC (12 GB) with one of these bad boys... I do prefer DLSS + RT @ 4K most games so it would have to be under these special circumstances. I already have an i5-12600k which is more than capable + 32GB of 3600 MHZ DDR4. Ugh why did I decided to upgrade during a GPU + memory shortage is beyond me.... LMAO. If anyone has any suggestions lmk. ;) Thanks for the video Linus as always <3 Edit: I think waiting for AMDs new line up would be the best decision. Intel seems kind of late into the game.
0,I dislike for Linus being excited at the beginning 😖
2,"You keeps talking about how the ARC A770 is sometimes competitive with the 3060, but has the specs of a 3070 class card; however, you haven't mentioned even once(to my knowledge) that, if you are willing to be an early adopter, there is a strong chance that future drivers will be able to streamline processes and unlock a not insignificant amount of the physically available power the card has similarly to how AMD got up to a 10% performance boost out of their 6000 cards(my 6700xt and I appreciated the boost.) As someone who is very interested in experimenting with new hardware, this is a huge selling point and could very well be a deciding factor for the enthusiast early adopters you're calling upon to pick them up."
2,"I came here to ask where can I buy the hat, mum told me would look good on me."
0,Videos like these are self explanatory of why Linus is one of the most hated people on YouTube
1,ngl the RGB on that card is looking dope! Sadly I need a more powerful gpu. I hope they can do some drivers magic.. and will be able to be really competetive in the future.
0,"Look like a terrible GPU for gamers that love older games. I don't think buying this GPU is a good idea anyway. We know what kind of price Intel give to their CPU, and you can be sure they will do the same with their GPU once they are good enough."
0,Won't buy anything else but the best AMD always
2,"With Linux, if you're buying brand new hardware, you want to be on the latest release anyways, really nothing new. And unlike Windows 12, you can still use whatever desktop or user-space that you want."
2,Did you stick your finger into a fan?
2,Competition to drive down prices is what we all need. Make it so.
0,"I'm sorry but whoever makes your graphs needs to get a lesson in all the colors of the rainbow. I hate when two bars are using different shades of the same color. You couldn't make on of them yellow? I realize it's ""Team blue"" but it's just so much harder to read the data."
2,"I'm willing to give ARC GPUs a go when they launch, I did the same when swapping from a 2060 to an RX 6600 just out of curiosity. Plus unlike Nvidia and AMD it is within my budget with seemingly great performance. Glad we've got red team, green team and finally blue team in the market for the true RGB experience"
2,"Bro they are targeting MacBook. If they achiveve great success with their own mobile gpu in an ultrabook, programmers, specially data science and ml engineers might choose a intel based system over mac. I would. Yes they have internal gpu setups already. but this will be at least 10times better."
2,Can it run pubg at consistent fps? The most ignored Battle Royale is also the best and is so bad optimized that it's a really good test for graphic cards. Lmao
2,"I'd really love more competition on the graphics card market. If Intel plays in the same league as Nvidia's high-end cards someday, I would give Intel a try."
2,"It kinda sucks that I bought a new GPU so recently, because I would love to join this group of folks giving Intel a shot. I’ll probably jump in at Gen 2 or if they make it, Gen 3."
1,I'd want Intel to succeed so much. I hope it will be their success
2,can´t find any intel A770 16gb to buy it....

2,"Partly buy AMD just to spite Nvida's stupid prices, although mostly because THE PRICE TOO DAMN HIGH."
2,"Nvidia, champ of gpu, but overpriced as hell.

AMD, vocal fanbase (BuT iTs JuSt As GoOd FoR lEsS) but have yet to see an actual system outperform an intel/Nvidia system 🤷🏻‍♂️

Good luck Intel"
0,"If I had more disposable income I would try it just out of curiosity, but asking me to quite literally throw $300 out of the window on a 1st gen GPU that clearly has massive issues and will for some time to come, when the inflation spike of 2022 skyrocketed living costs in my area more than the inflation of the entire decade since 2010, is simply too large of an ask. Sorry Intel, let the rich kids play with your issues."

2,"Imaging all Intel set, it should works correctly, right?"
2,Card nice but why no linuuuux
2,"Going to be frank, 2nd place does not matter a whole lot in this space. I want Intel to compete so bad with the big N but they just don't right now. Framerate and stability is king and that's why Green gets away with charging what they do. If i go buy a high end card from Green it works out of the box period. No messing around with weird drivers or quirks of the card. In the end this is why they are at the top. They are the best in the space and they know it and charge accordingly. We shall see how RDNA 3 turns out. AMD hype seems to be a real thing in the past few years so here's some measured hope that it does well. Intel will probably need 2-3 more generations to be that competition that we so desire."

0,wtf who still play direct 9 or 10 game in 2022
2,"I fully understand the plea to buy it simply because it’s competition and not because it’s fully mature yet. Intel needs impetus to continue development. I won’t put one in my top end gaming rig, but I’ll use an Intel card in a mid range office PC I have planned. I think the card will do fine and look great in the case I have if nothing else."
2,"Intel is OEM provider already I don't really see any actual struggle here $ wise.    

Get adopted by most gamers, HELL NO! you have to earn that!"

0,"No thanks, i also play retro games in the side and they're sometimes troublesome enough to get running. I can't imagine the nightmare Arc would be for that."
1,Intel is cool again
2,"I really want to root for Intel here, not because I like Intel (meh) but because I'd love to see a third player in this GPU race to inflate.  But if there is absolutely one focus point that Intel desperately needed to make out of the gate with Arc, it was the one area where integrated Intel graphics have absolutely suffered: firmware.  Intel *NEEDED* Arc to come out swinging with some absolutely polished drivers if they were going to convince me.  Instead, what is the one massive failure of Intel Arc?  *FIRMWARE* !!!  Intel, WTAF?!?!  I get your point, Linus.  But to also paraphrase a bit on WAN Show recently, sometimes the fly doesn't deserve that honey.  Intel really has to address this specter haunting Intel graphics FOR DECADES if they want to prove Arc."
1,I'll get one
1,"Oh, I thought Intels cards were actually a lot worse...Anything above RTX2060 (which i own 2 of...and for me and are absolutely doing its work in 1440p) - if they compete above it...wow. Not too shabby. Nvidia and AMD needs competition....and this is good. Still. I just bought a RTX3080 but who knows in the future....Interesting."
2,"I wonder how long a 3-way competition will last. It's pretty common for tech products to end up with 2-way competition, so will somebody have to bow out of the market in a few years?"
2,Drivers Drivers Drivers
2,If they'd have only show up at the peak of GPU demand they'd have been the big winner. Now it's going to be an uphill battle.
0,"forget about RTX 3060 and compare this card straight to the RX 6600 in 1080p. I'm pretty sure the RX 6600 will destroy this card and is much cheaper than the RTX 3060.

Now talk about Ray tracing it's still not powerful enough so it doesn't matter both card won't use them anyway at 1080p."
0,"I want there to be a 3rd player, just not Intel. They’ve insulted their customers making absolute crap tier graphics for decades. Awful drivers that never got fixed. They deserve to fail. Would love to see S3 come back, HTC would probably need to spin them off first."
0,"Well actually since those GPUs are only going to take place into prebuilt computers, and we don't even know if there will be custom editions from other brands, I'll stick to Nvidia and AMD graphics card."
0,I would not buy an Intel card. They could just throw in the towel 6 months from now and quit supporting their GPU's.
2,Team blue/green buyout/merger on the horizon?
0,1:15 - ridge wallet destroyed all my cards in a space of a week. overpriced bunk. 👎
1,i do think intel as much as its having issues is showing promise so hopefully this is just gen 1 issues no matter what having another competitor for nvidia and AMD is huge for us consumers
2,AMD for life!!! 💪💪💪
1,Cool !
2,The last thing keeping me from buying an Intel card is the GN Tear Down Video. It’s so painful. The ASRock A380 as an encoder I can see though.
0,I will only buy one Intel Gpu. I'm still salty about all the shady stuff Intel and them pull.
0,The fact that they aren't supporting older version of the linux kernels but also try to market the new method of performing matrix operations is counter intuitive given most AI/ML research is done on linux machines.

2,still redpilled
2,"can't. need those cuda cores for python , otherwise i would :-(. Edit , there are some results for intel arc pytorch integration, but i couldnt find any benchmarks for it. If anyone has found them pls let me know"

1,I'm getting an RTX 4090
1,"Support competition! 
I know Intel isn't exactly the little ""mom and pop"" shop taking on the big guys or anything, but shaking up a duopoly is a worthy cause regardless"
0,Get that therefore symbol out of there if you're going to somehow drop the approximation.
0,"I was planning on getting one of these but the lack of immediate Linux support is a bummer.  I don't have a problem compiling my own kernel, but it's been years since I have had to. And now I am even more concerned that running 4 4k monitors off the thing will take a long time to actually work.  The last time I tried it with nouveau it still wasn't usable.  I don't even game, so no expectations on that front."
0,"iam glad that intel's in the ring now, but iam disapointed. this was to be expected but still. yes i want there to be competition, but iam not spending my money, to get a sub par product in order for them, to see that it sells and they improve the next version, while i have to live with downsides and problems until the next one releases. and yes, youre right, someone has to buy it, but my guess is, it wont be as many people as you may hope for, and thats for a good reason. we need something, that can compete, but i dont really see arc as competition for my uses. and if intel stays its ground, but does what amd did and only competes with low end and mid tier, then IDC because thats no my range anway, so competition there, doenst change anything for me. biggest reason against arc for me, is the nearly 50 watt idle."
0,"I've had to take apart a GPU on more than one occasion, and these intel cards with no screws look like a nightmare to disassemble."
0,"""Someone needs to buy it""...such a back-handed thing to say.

Price is everything to many people and thus is actually the better option. Also, who uses Steam Charts for proof of anything anymore? Steam has been losing popularity and influence for years."
2,hmmm i wonder how bad it would bottleneck with a 4790k.
2,"The GPUs definitely have potential, however the translation from earlier DX to DX12 is going to REALLY drag them down. Old games are being reintroduced because new games have been absolute horrendous piles of flaming trash. Theyll need to provide better support in some way some how."
2,Now we just need Nvidia CPUs and the RGB battle will begin
2,italian people know Grazia ARC4770 before intel
0,I'm sorry but you couldn't pay me to buy an Intel gpu. Not only are they garbage but Intel is a garbage company that spent a decade (when AMD was trash) milking the consumers without giving even a hint of performance gains
1,"I am so happy about this, I will let a few things slide to avoid buying NVIDIA. What they did to the gaming community was worse than a cheating spouse, which is unforgivable in most cases. I am confident in time the old game/driver issues will be fixed."
0,I'd love to.... But I just watched a teardown video.... I'll pass..
0,I can't believe people feel bad about intel's bad performance and are willing to sponsor this crap GPU just to despise nvidia. Intel is 70 Billion usd revenue company which could not organize sufficient engineering effort to build appropriate gaming video card. They deserve this and I hope they never try this embarrassing attempt without properly investing and committing to do it right.
2,They need a n 80/90 level offering first.
2,"and the full labels are full, the deliverence Is real money is alot/none in the existence, never quite couldn't not just mop in my permenance"
0,"i not even watched the video but, NO THANK YOU."
1,"The performance and price sound pretty damn good, although I'm still a little skeptical after watching Steve's tear down. Having no choice but to irreparably damage the card if you need to swap fans or reapply thermal paste/change pads etc. hurts it's longevity quite a bit. I have faith Intel will fix that down the road though, these have a lot of promise and it's pretty awesome that we're getting a 3rd big gpu competitor!"
1,"Nice video.
The issue however lies somewhere else entirely:

1. The problem isn't the product, but its introduction and promises - messed up marketing.
2. Introducing hardware too new for drivers they already had, and then jumping the gun with early alphas.
3. Wrong target group - if you come out with new hardware on a highly contested market, you just don't go for the peek but a lower safe target.

If those cards had been introduced to the market as DX 12 + Vulkan Office to Midrange solutions ranging from 120€ to 250€ from the very start, refusing to even run older games or APIs, then everything would have been fine. Then ""gifting"" decent support for older games a year or so later would even have made them king."
2,"Or just buy a recently launched 4090 cards. How much more do they cost compared to arc 50, 100£ maybe"
2,"Hey Linus, it would be interesting to know the heat output to fps ratio of these cards. Home theatre pc’s could benefit it’s superior."

0,"1/3fps in SolidWorks with visual anomalies.  A 10 year old iGP is faster without the anomalies.  So completely broken on the most basic levels.  It would make more sense for me to send Intel $100 with a note saying to keep making cards.  That way I'm only out $100, Intel gets more than the profit from one of these cards, and I don't waste any time fighting the bugs."

1,I am really happy to see you using Topaz Enhance AI for your benchmarks!
2,"I think buying it for the sake of competition is not right. Customers are NOT charity, and when they receive a product it must be a complete and relatively pain-free experience.

This is the same reason why we still shat on AMD's drivers after all these years even though their drivers are much better right now."

2,"Just considering the silicon, I bet these cards get substantially better with driver updates."
2,"I think it would have been more clever for Intel to sell their GPUs at much lower price to get people transition from NVIDIA/AMD. I mean, everyone of us has had GPUs from one of them for so many years, and now there is a new competitor, whose GPU ist just slightly cheaper for the same performance. I am sure there are many who think ""Nah, I better pay 10% more and have a GPU from a company I know for many years""."

1,As an average gamer that is fine with 1080p 60 fps these intel ARC cards look great and affordable.
2,"Can't help with that. My last GPU died last year so i was forced to buy a new one during the high-price GPU time (and went with ""if i HAVE to buy one at least grap a top shelf model"", as in: a Radeon RX 6900 XT) so my GPU budget is gone for quite a while."
2,I would see how the card perform with proton and DX9-11 Games. Maybe Proton does a better Job

0,"While I think it's good and about time some competition is introduced to the landscape considering Nvidia's death grip and ego as a result of what essentially is a monopoly, I'm just not sure how to feel about Intel being the ones to challenge them. With Intel's history of being arguably worse in terms of antitrust and consumer minded as a company.
The situation is really just sad and tiresome to even think about."
2,What does everyone think about using it for say an HTPC?
2,Linus dropping the hoodie $90 ad like he’s not talking about a budget graphics card 🤣
2,Assetto Corsa Competizione? Iracing? Orig Assetto Corsa?

2,"The biggest thing holding me back is the linux support. I'm looking to transition to full-time linux daily driver. I don't mind the performance hits so much, even though I do play a mix of old and new titles. I honestly would really love some competition in this space and don't want Intel to kill this project before it has a chance to get off the ground. But come on, no support for current stable linux builds? Who dropped several balls there?"

2,Is it good for VR at all?
1,I support the approach to rid old gen hw optimizations. It's a total waste of silicon space that could be doing something much more useful. This is what made Apple's M1 so successful. This should happen more often. Game developers or distributors could learn over time how to effectively compile their games to new gen instructions - if it can be done at run time by hardware translation layer then it can be done at compile time - it's a problem that well designed software delivery systems could tackle - meaning hardware could be iterating more rapidly with faster bigger gains. Imagine where we could download games that have been built-optimized to run on our specific hardware.
1,"I would've gone for ""Full-silicon Alchemist"" in the title screen but what they ended up with is an decent enough alternative.

How fitting for a video about buying Intel ARC."
0,"intel only supporting Linux kernel 6 is just insult to injury.

WTF intel? what's your damn problem!?"
2,Did Otacon just voice the wallet ad?
1,"To be honest Intel ARC 7 looks very good. For 349$ you will get full version of card (not these chopped off Nvidias), which could have still potential get's improve in performance with new drivers. AMD now have got quite dangerous competitor, they should get priced they new GPUs according to Intel's ARC. NVIDIA as producer of gaming GPUs is totally done, they went with path as in 90's Intergraph and their 6000$ cards which has been totally destroyed by 3Dfx."
0,pass
2,"i would love to see the a770s machine learning performance, i think their architecture + the 16gig version could be a great card for that type of workload, but they don't have support for pytorch / other typical ML frameworks yet"
0,"Shills even saying to buy GPU waste 300 dollars that you can't play the game you own .

Why the hell would anyone play on pc if not for backwards compatibility and higher fps for old games ."
1,A third actor in the GPU market would be so nice to have. I'm tempted to buy one for my HTPC just to support the potential for intel to take part in it. Also Intel is at least as Open Source friendly as AMD maybe even more so
1,Would definetly buy one if i didnt have an 3060 already and i play a lot of retro games. Definetly looking for their next gen that competes with 4080 12 gb XD
2,Just want to ask if this GPU can handle After Effects rendering. If it can shorten the rendering time then I'll buy it.
2,"I wish there was a channel who would compare performance within creative softwares such as adobe, 3d software and so on. not just for games and kids who cry when their fps drops from 170 to 168fps"
1,I'm sorry but if i am buying a new graphics card i don't want to be playing it at medium settings  at 1440p
1,performance per $ is really good. hope they can stay alive to push Nvidia and AMD to more performance per $ too. I.E lower prices.
1,Words are Nice. If u want to see changes in the GPU Market go buy Intel Arc
0,LINUS YOURE FULL OF IT.  We the consumers wont fall for bullshit content creators.
1,I want Intel to be successful in the GPU market.
2,Want to build a beast machine next year BUT this card makes me want to do a budget build. I won't mind a computer upstairs to just throw flight sim on and handle some more mundane tasks.
2,i don´t consider the arg GPU as my main driver currently but i considder it for my secronday grafics card

2,I really hope Nvidia enters see desktop CPU market or snapdragon
1,"This looks like a solid start for Intel making GPUs. They are looking to the future and the next generation of their GPUs and making sure they are not held back by backwards compatibility. I get how that is frustrating right now, but I can see that giving them an edge in the future."
2,I'm planning on getting a 750 for my first ever GPU. Just hoping it isn't more expensive than a 6600 in Australia
1,"It really is a strange product, because if you tend to play modern current games, you should be pretty happy with it, especially at that price point. But that's the catch, do most gamers even know what version of Direct X their favorite games are? I think at that price, it's rather nice - as long as you tend to play current games. But it's also interesting to think that, Intel is no slouch, so the next gen of their products will be even more interesting."
2,You are simply not going to notice the difference between 90 FPS and 120FPS. Providing those figures are constant.
2,I have a 1070 and want to upgrade. Would this be a good upgrade?
1,"They look to be good budget options for gamers who just want a modern system which can run low requirements games like MMOs or ARPGs which has decent enough GRAM that you don't lose framerate from crowds or massive monster packs.  Without having to break the bank with features you'll never take advantage of like Ray Tracing. 

Considering how AMD is hit and miss while Nvidia has gone off the deep end.  Intel seems like a viable budget option... so long as the game utilizes DirectX12... if it isn't using DirectX12, don't bother.  Yeah this card does not like older games and I guess it being cheaper is to account for that.  Unfortunate."
1,Intel actually has an excellent future in the GPU market if they just keep at it.
2,"You're right but the price is too high. In Europe now you can buy a modded 3060 at same price, next week you are going to buy a 3060ti or even a 3070 at the same price. I think that Intel have waited too much, at least 2 months. Before September Intel GPU would destroyed the market. Right now if you buy is only to support the project not for the product. Why Intel? Why?"
2,The change will only happen if the 4080 12 piles up in inventory even after 2 to 3 price cuts
1,Intel only starting to support Linux version 6.0 is good because then they can concentrate on newer versions without needing to update some legacy versions
2,I hate the gpu monopoly we have that's similar to that of an iphone. Completely different rtx ranges every year makes you think they're always downplaying their new technology just so they can release better ones next year and make more money. It's not about innovation anymore. Competition is the key to efficiency.
2,lmao bitcoin miners will make us sad
2,Does anyone have any idea how the a770 will perform in valorant compared to my current 2060 super 8gb
2,Intel has gigantic cash reserves. And you want me to “support” them by buying their shoddy CPUs?
1,I would still buy one over any AMD card
2,And what about the A770 of 16gbs?
2,1:07 pretty excited eh? Then it was probably viagra.😅
0,Linus ate a sandwich before and forgot to clean his shirt.

0,Linus needing viagra in his age is pretty lame xD
0,Oh no! It can only push 167 fps at 1440p in cs:go *eye roll* why we even use C's:go as a benchmark. I feel like a potato could get 60fps in cs:go
0,"""Shill hat"" may seem like poking fun of the fact that LTT loves to celebrate every product sponsored as the greatest thing ever until the next sponsor comes by. In reality, it's more like those ""Unbankrupt Yourself"" T-shirts that crypto-scammer made after making billions of other people's money disappear. ""I make money from Intel. You do not."". And talking about T-shirts... How far up your own backside does your head have to be to not understand how utterly bad taste that ""Trust Me Bro Warranty"" shirt was? Not a single fiber in Mr. Linus Gabriel Sebastians body seemed to do anything besides gleefully celebrate ""dunking on his haters"". ""Ha, ha - we make money selling this T-shirt, so that's proof I AM RIGHT"". There is a lot of interesting body language to be read from Luke in a few of those clips. Because he's not a self-absorbed, insecure peddler that can't take criticism and expects to be celebrated and loved just because he's a YouTuber."
1,i still see this as a big win in attempting to make gpu prices better and getting their foot in the door... intel has a long ways to go and a lot of things to learn but hopefully in the future they catch up and surpass other graphics card competitors.it will be ahuge leap in affordable gamming
0,Gamers Nexus already pointed out why they are bad. Sorry Linus I know you are paid out by them.
0,Intel is still alive?
1,Everything is so comparable barring DirectX 11. Honestly at four times the price but only marginally better performance I would say this is a great card for Budget people
1,"This is good either way. As time goes on, Intel will improve in the GPU scene and with that, hopefully the entire market will improve."
2,Intel should just take the loss for future benefits. Selling a card that can rack a game like Rocket League at 130fps for like 200 bucks right now would be killier.
2,"I currently have a GTX 1650 and will likely upgrade soon, now my problem does I go AMD as I am running R5 5600X, or will Arc 750 be better??? ( also finance is limited so my going out and getting the latest and greatest is not happening anytime soon.... )"
2,"Why are people talking about prices when we don't even know if this ""Intel GPUs"" is even usable in gaming? Mfker is gonna be used to play a 2008 game."
0,"Ah without linux, I have no reason to buy Arc at all. I hoped it would have been a solid encoder and support virtualization"
2,"I would buy it... if they actually made a fucking enthusiast level card and not just this low end crap. Going into the RTX 4000 series... the last thing I have an incentive to buy is a GPU that is the same power as the 3070 I already own. Unfortunately, I think I have no choice but to buy Nvidia this time around again (specifically a 4080 because thats the power level I wanted this time)."
2,average rx570 user - okay
0,"Intel is a big company and simping for them with a shit product is coming across as a bit disingenious (appealing to buy arc gpu),
like i get competition is great and all but intell is a big company they aren't a small brand that needs sympathy points for competition. 
I sincerly doubt that this card flopping will make intell stop trying to get into the gpu market.
The plea to buy it idk like if there's a conflict of interest? like ik you have allot of intell sponserships so would you seriously go as harsh as you should in a review on an intell product?

They need to release a good product that performs consistently, and make a good driver package. It appears much worse than when amd gpus had huge driver issues."
2,"If it worked on Linux I would do this
Also maybe if I didn't have an i5-4460 lol"
0,That woke intel company i hope they fall down
2,“The bulge in your pants shouldn’t be from your wallet”😂😂😂
2,"The fact that the Linux drivers were merged into the latest mainline release is not too surprising. That's how all new features hit the mainline, and usually precedes backports to the stable branch. It's quite likely you'll see driver support in various distro vendor kernels with versions lower than 6.0 as they do hardware enablement updates."
2,"Heck with that, get a 6800 vanilla. They're $500 now. You can get a XT used for that much if you trust the seller. I may hold off to November. The prices are still dropping. I only play games in January and February anyway."
0,"I am sorry but the butt fisting Intel did when they were dominating the market with CPU's, price gouging and delaying releases just cause, up until Ryzen launched I will not be buying Intel ever again. Waiting and hoping the 7000 GPU series from AMD will shake things up at last"
2,Uhhhh CSGO is not dx9 anymore. Though you can put put in as a launch option for it. The A380 was paired with a i3 12100F and averaged like 270. So if you have a AM4 or 10th gen intel that's not a thing you will do or think about. Dota 2 is vulcan now. And CSGO might go that way as well. So. I don't know how many old games will be horribly effected in a gpu power since. That people will really care about. It's just stability and drivers really. Why they won't just go hey. We are supporting all our cards drivers for 3 years. In writing I don't know. I guess it's insulting to question their reputation or something. Odd thinking really. They much think we all have Intel-tt body pillows or something. I had to do it. There was no other option. Trust me. Though I would be interested to know the full effects on performance of their dx9 emulation.

1,"I'd buy it if only it was even available in my country, there's just none"
1,Man I hope Intel sticks around
1,I would buy if the card came with that ARC neon table light thingy on your table.
0,"Was actually thinking of buying an arc GPU, then saw a teardown video of it, and it was an ugly process much like disassembling an iphone. 
Intel failed to make good drivers and also made servicing it very difficult and risky. Good luck cleaning it or reapplying thermal paste.
This put me off. Don't think it's a good option, they should have thought about this point."

2,I bought my 3080 ti two month ago and my brother told me to wait so I can buy all the parts at once and I was impatient spent 1.3k also I thought well i probably won’t see this in stock in a while so I might as well two months it’s at 800 or 700 I’m doing fine 🙂
1,I agree with linus.  I want a lot of OTHER people to buy this and keep intel in the game.  If we got to a roughly 33/33/33 market share split that would be SICK for competition.
1,"I'd consider it, if I could find someone that sold it. Where can you buy the A770?"
1,"Why don't you buy a bunch and give them away?  Not to me, I have a 3080, but to other people.  :P

joking aside, I agree with you."
1,"Most of my customers at my work are employees at the intel factory across the street. I've built relationships with a few and they light up when I ask about their work. One was happy to divulge that next year, ""we've really got something to kick nvidia's ass"""
0,GN is better
1,If I didn't already have an RX 6800XT I would have bought one... I definitely like the looks of the cards. I would bet Intel will improve greatly with driver maturity. We should revisit benchmarks in a year on these cards.
2,"Intel is a multi billion dollar company, they don't need our money to survive. This graphic card in most of the cases is a coin flip. If it works then great, if not then sucks. We working hard for the money and can not afford to give away for a not fully working ( or a low quality ) product. The ray tracing performance is very impressive for a first attempt. The energie efficiency is very low, this alone is a deal breaker for me."
2,"Intel GPUs will be interesting if they succeed with gen 2 and gen 3, until then I’ll stick with AMD for budget and NVIDIA for max performance."
0,its sad that the performance in Blender is not good. Especialy that Intel is a Platin Memeber of blender. But im also not willing to pay Nvidia prices only for the Performenc :(
2,Idc if I get less fps I will always have my 120 hz monitor even if I get like 300 fps it will fix it to 120 fps only
0,I think Ill just stick with my little 6500XT for now. Not upgrading mb's again for a while as mine doesn't have that fancy lane thingie. And there is no way in hell I will be buying a video card capable of browning out small countries with the insane power draws. and even bigger the a snowball's chance in hell of me ever using an nshitttya card.  Which brings me to our sponsor... LTT store no way would I pay over $30 for a plastic water bottled that cost under a quarter produce and another 12 cents for printing a name on it. and don't even get me started on that screw driver....   But you guys are welcome to keep buying all this over priced shit and perpetuating the raping of the entire gaming community You are all just as bad as the miners.
1,"I remember how it was such a big deal for me to spend $200 on an Nvidia TNT2 Ultra back in the 90s.  These days $200 won't get you much.  The Nvidia AMD duopoly have driven prices way too high.

2,Intel is clearly targeting small/medium business markets with the arc.
2,"@ 3:59 we have a table that shows that a 780GTX out performs even the bets arc card.

I made a new PC 4 years ago even thou the then new GPU generation ( the 20xx series ) were a large price increase and small performance increase over the previous generation because i had an old PC that I had waited far to long to upgrade and it was not able to give acceptable FPS even at 1080p any longer.

That PC had a 780GTX in it!

Why on earth would intel only make some entry level cards. 
did they just get an embedded GPU, increase its performance to just enough to run games and put it in the PCI-E card?"
2,It's red pill not blue pill. Did you watch the matrix?
1,in a year if their drivers improve
2,Too late i already bought a 3080 lmao

As soon as I find a A700 card available in under 200mm I will be upgrading my whole system (No PCIe 4.0, no SAM/resizable bar). I’d love to make it a full Intel box, but if the price isn’t right, a ryzen CPU will work as well. I don’t need a powerful system in this role and a i3-12100 will probably be enough, but I want to support future competition."
1,I need a budget GPU right now. I am considering this I just don't know if they sell in South Africa
2,Laughs in 3080ti

I heard you talk that you devide the price so people who live in remote ares can still oorder from you for ok price for them compare to other stores. Well I think that live in the major city and live in some forest have their pluses and minuses and one of the benefits for city is cheap delivery availability. Peiple who live in clam empty area sacrifice such luxury. Sorry, I don't share your point of view about shearing and that such price for delivery is OK."

2,"Something often overlooked is that the 770 is actually decent in many titles at 4k with a couple settings dialed back. It somehow scales with higher resolutions much better than the competition, so the future is extremely bright for Intel if the next gen does the same."
2,"well some Cryptominer should buy it, last year they tryharded to buy every Nvidia card... They seem to have enough money then they should buy Arc.... I´m heading towards RTX 4090 anyway"
1,Good thing on Linux. Intel Drivers are open source and everything goes through Vulkan so no problems with lower than x12
1,"pretty sure that by the time i can build a new machine kernel 6 is gonna be running on there, cause i'm expecting it on my current rig any day now... i love rolling releases. also, thank you intel for actually considering linux at all, unlike the ****s at nvidia."

2,"Linus being nice to the 4060Ti calling it a 4070.
That's cute.

Both memory bus and gap performance, and gap cuda core correlate that it is a 4060ti."
0,Mark my words their GPU's will fail. No one wants 3rd best 😂. I wouldn't put one of these Intel cards in my system if it was free. Just go with a console if you're even thinking of these weak cards.
2,if that AI thing is true and propagates to crypto mining I can assure you Intel doesn't need anyone else than miners to bomb this launch and secure next gen funds xD
2,"i like the design. that matte black. The problem is compatibility with older games as well as possible video editing or 3d modeling that is still being developed on the older Dirext X. Possible driver problems... The price is $289, but the market will put it on par with the rtx 3060 and that will be the price. Maybe a few dollars will go down, but it's difficult. Maybe it doesn't write ""Intel"" on the product. And ""Intel"" does not have cheap products. But anything is better than nothing.."
2,"I’m a streamer and honestly, I’ll probably go ahead and get the Intel Card. I don’t play a lot of the bigger newer games that would really put stress on it, and it seems like it’s encoding will be really beneficial. Plus I’m not upgrading from a newer card on my desktop, but an older one. If I wanna play a newer and more stressful games, I have a Series X for that. If I wanna play older games, that aren’t Direct X 12, I can just deal with it not being 120+ fps. As long as I’m getting around 60, I’m generally happy. I’m not big on First Person Shooters, and generally play those on console anyways, so I don’t see any reason to buy one of the best Nvidia cards for hundreds more to have bigger number lol."

2,"Ok, so if the hardware IS there, will we see this GPU age well with newer drivers? Kinda like AMD's got better performance after launch?"
2,"I'm fine with my RX580, but will maybe consider this if I build another PC in three or four years. Until then most LTS Linux Distros should also support it."
2,"As for the kernel versoin on linux, mine is running 6.0 so that would be just fine. It also is not uncommon for the open source drivers to work only on the latest kernel version at launch. Linux folks either accept that or wait for a bit after launch."

2,"It'd probably be about as good or worse than my current 2070 Super, and I'd worry about compatibility with older operating systems and games that I use sometimes. So I won't buy one now. But maybe their next product... especially if it said EVGA on it..."
1,HOLY SHIT THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING.
2,Amd gpus are low life they dont worth even 200$
2,Not sure about that Linux to Windows analogy. I've upgraded my kernel many times and there's plenty of guides already for upgrading to 6.0. All for free as well.
2,"Funny enough, this card will perform much better on Linux than Windows for gaming. Since games on Linux go through Vulkan and Intel GPUs already fully support that. Kernel 6.0 is your friend."
2,"Not sure why linus keeps referring nvidias $329 msrp 3060 as a $400 card. Thats 3060 TI tier. Also Nvidia “jacking up the price” is more-so from retailers and scalpers. If you really want to compare intels arc to something on the market right now, theres AMD 6700 XT available  on newegg for $380. That should be a more fair price/performance comparison."
0,if the prices would translate to real market prices then i wouldnt think a second and grab a 16gb 770 buuuuuuut never.D
1,"I would say, that one shouldn't underestimate Intel and its capabilities. For a first-gen card, if the roll-out is ""smooth"" i.e. no major problems with games's compatibility, like if it plays league of legends, DOTA2, and fortnite, just fine; it's considered a ""success"".
Bare in mind, when AMD bought over Radeon; Radeon was already in the GPU game for awhile. It didn't take them very long to get to where they're at today, side by side with Nvidia.
Intel didn't buy over anybody; scratched/ restarted their GPU programme at least twice; and yet, here they are, still grinding through it. With Intel's resources; give them 3-4 years, perhaps, by then, we'll truly see a real competitor from Intel. I would say, as a starter of 1st-gen, Intel checked off on every cylinder; it's not perfect, but it works, and that's what would payed its future path
Vice-versa; would we see Nvidia releasing CPU soon? I'd like to see how it'll be standing next to Intel's 12th gen, and etc. What comes around goes around; it wouldn't be long until Intel become one of the dominant players in GPU side as well. The good thing is, at least Intel is brave enough to take a deep dive into GPU segment."
2,Think they just need one more gen.
2,I would if Intel allows you to have a threadripper 2990wx
0,"While I do love the benefits of competition, I have no love for intel anymore. Went full AMD on my latest build, previously was an intel/nvidia guy all the way."
1,"I am honestly changing my setup for something a bit budget now, since pandemic making me lose my job is still hurting and got my old reliable laptop with a 1050TI that's not really working its best anymore and been looking at Intel for a while, so this video honestly convinced me to give it a shot so thank you"
0,I'll buy that junk in 2077 lmao.
2,"Man, that did take a while to get kernel 6.0... two days.... I thought it would never end <g>"
2,im still running a gtx970.  if its cheap enough i will consider it. cuz i dislike the idea  that you need to spend 400+ dollar for a gpu ...
0,"Please don't buy this. Don't pay to be a beta tester. If the card isn't ideal for your purposes then don't do it to take one for the team. Intel releasing the bare minimum should not be rewarded on any level and only furthers the monopoly, justifying the high prices set by nvidia because they are clearly not competing with nvidia in any way here. At least AMD goes hard on games even if productivity prowess is not up to par with nvidia."
0,"Well, Intel's lack of Linux support cost them my potential business."
1,"I'm probably gonna pair this with my 6900 xt on my current build, they kinda compliment each other in a cool way and having both should make either a glitchy mess or a really crazy good system. Amd tends to die with higher resolution and ray tracing, and with the little extra power of the a750 it should push it past a 3090 ti in pretty much everything. And I hate nvidia.

Also my friend is building a pc soon, I'll use an a750 instead of a 3060. Cheaper, and it'll give him crazy performance for price. Same with the 13th gen i5 ima get him"
2,"3:55, dang 3050 was 9 years ago?"
2,"The other thing is as drivers and so on get better, you may see a small improvement in games maybe 10-20 percent in the future on older games and 5-10 percent in newer ones."
0,$289 is still too much
2,bro would paired light green to white text for these graphs

0,Definitely，this is a ad.
2,"Guys dose intel have something like dlss
I have a rtx 3060 and I m happy for those who can get a similar card at a lower priece but the dlss was such grate thing for me(especialy when playing with rtx on or 4 k ) and  it realy push the gpu forword 
I know there is fsr by AMD in certin games which baisicaly do the exact thing but I heard that the fsr performs worse in gpu's that aren't from AMD (then again I can't give my opinion on it since I haven't tried it or have an AMD gpu) 
So I was wandering if this card could do the same thing as the rtx ?"
0,short answer; nope.

2,Aight I'm buying I'm cheap and need Ray tracing
1,I'm buying it even if it was crap just not buy nvidia or amd
2,What about an Intel ARC for video encoding and Ray Tracing and an AMD RX for general gaming?
1,"As a Linux user, i like the fact that Intel made a dedicated GPU.  Because these cards will be supported out of the box at the Kernel level.  100% plug-n-play. :)"

2,"Thumbed down for the beginning of the video.  
Too much of this video is a ridiculous assault of fast cuts, fast zooms, close ups, effects and otherwise.  Its a jittery pain to watch.
Seriously Josh, watch your video from 0:35 to 1:45, 5 times in a row.
Its just a bad assembly of over-editing and over-cleverness that doesn't work.
There is no smoothness in watching you complete a sentence but having the camera zoom or close up 3 times.
The video should be easy to watch, not a disjointed pain."

2,"my wife used to not like spam. I told her it's all about how one cooks the spam and utilizes that extra salty flavor. What's something good to pair with salty goodness? Tators.

I like to fry up some tators and add in cubed spam to fry with them as spam also tends to have a lot of fatty oil. Those tators just suck up all that salty glistening goodness.

The wife and kids can't get enough of it.

Thanks for this video. We prefer to make as much as we can at home. This will be fun to make for her and the kids as a surprise :)"

Even when I was growing up in the 90's it was all soups, stews, spam sandwiches, hotdogs & beans etc. And it's funny because now, even though I have money of my own to eat other things, those budget meals are still some of my go-to comfort foods."

2,Quick tip: For anyone doesn't like how salty spam is. Simmer it in plain water for 5 minutes. It much less salty after. Although it is also less firm. I use it in fried rice which has other salty ingredients and can easly get too salty.

0,As a child I loved fried Spam sandwiches. In the 70s. A few years ago I bought some Spam to make these sandwiches again. I couldn't finish my 1st sandwich and threw it and the Spam into the trash. I prefer a little more meat in the can of gelatanized salt that I purchased. Seriously. It was like a slice of salt flavored with a little bit of meat. Disgusting.
1,Dude that spamwich looked fire
1,yassssss
2,"In Germany (at least here in the south, I don't know about the rest of the country) we have a long tradition of making homemade spam-like pork in glass jars as  a way to preserve the meat, with lot's of different flavor profiles. That's why I never understood the hate for spam, as that just seemed like a mass market version of what I can get from every local butcher around here. Absolutely Love the stuff."
2,"I kept trying to figure out what “frog powder number 1” was. Replayed that part a few times. Still sounded like frog. Turned on closed captions. It said “proc powder” and was therefore still confused. But I kept thinking that he was using pink curing salt. Which is what it was. 

Now the question arises…how many frogs are in a jar of frog powder? 😂"

0,"You make such great videos, it's a shame that the weird edits make your videos borderline unwatchable. 

Don't get me wrong, I like a little randomness every once in a while. Pewdiepie is a great example of how you can add weird edits WITHOUT going overboard.

Your videos just make me cringe really hard to the point where I absolutely have to turn off the video despite the fact that I absolutely wanted to see the rest.

Then again, you probably don't care since I'm not your target audience anyway. You probably get a shit ton of views from young tik tokers who not only accept, but *expect* these kinds of edits.

Again, not trying to be a hater here but your weird ""edits"" are way too frequent and they pretty much ruin what would otherwise be one of the best cooking channels on Youtube."

0,"Hello, hello, there is something you need to know, you're making a small mistake that most don't know. Not in playing, nor your skills, but your talking time, that pays your bills. Yes, indeed I am talking about your sponsor, it must be an honor,  but you must ponder on the dishonor of the people that don't want to listen. Perhaps there is something missing. In the top left or top right of the screen, there should be a countdown timer, easily seen."
2,ad spot !!
1,"I love this game, and I would have loved to get into it because I love time trials. However, I really dislike that the game forces your camera into specific perspectives, it makes it impossible to see what it is my car is doing on any wall ride. Because I'm a new player and don't have the intuition for how the car controls during these, I would like to be able to observe how my inputs affect the car so I can learn what not to do."

0,Anybody who take pride and joy in the death of the queen should have the same fate as her. 80 years sooner.
2,Seeing a streamer have such an issue with downloading a meager 1.6GB of updates makes me grateful for not living in a country that is the equivalent of the second or even third world in terms of internet connectivity.
2,The Buckley's mum joke caught me off guard lmao
0,"Love the content, just can't deal with edits and uploads after six weeks. Granady and Scrapie have all the recent COTDs and recent content but you never do. Don't understand why. Unsubscribe from me for now."
0,"It's more distasteful for someone to be ruling over a population of people, benefiting from a life they randomly received whilst thousands and thousands of people die as a result of keeping the lifestyle of that one person and their family in their unelected position through taxation that does not provide the country any good. The queen could have attempted to change this system, make life for her subjects much more equitable, but she did nothing. She may only be head of state as a ceremonial role with no actual power, but due to this her position is not needed and only acts as a leech on society. Her death is not going to change anything but at least its one less member of the royal family."
2,5minutes for a gb? Downbad.
1,Happy birthday Buckley!
2,"Dead queen... Look how she raised Andrew. 
Imagine you're the dads of Andrew's victims...

2,What would happen if both finalists DNF?
0,""" dont disrespect the dead"" 
Dont be an awful person in life. ""dont disrespect the dead"" gives genuinely terrible people some solace that at least they'll have people like Wirtual defending them in death. The queen committed genocide in kenya to stop them from gaining independence. We should celebrate the deaths of people whos sole goal in life was to hurt others to gain power"

On serious note, are Manscaped Products good? Free shipping globally + 20% off is kinda tempting"
2,"You know, it's kinda bittersweet. 

A Wirtual ad. One on hand, *zomg fukn ad*

On the other hand, you're starting to get more and more successful. As a guy who's been around your channel here on youtube since before TM2020 came out, I've always enjoyed the high quality content you've posted. Hopefully now you can start getting properly rewarded for your effort. Not to mention, with ez ad money you can finally afford to buy buckley his waffle maker. Or, to be fair, give his mom the money for it, because, well, you know... 

I'm just a voice into the void, but congrats, Wirtual."

2,I've never seen a Frenchman beat off so many Germans before. Not on this website at least.

2,"""is anyone happy the queen is dead?""  Yeah Wirtual.  Quite a few people."
2,"Hey Wirtual, have you considered shifting to youtube for livestreams? It really does seem like twitch is gonna die soon and with the recent effort from YouTube towards improving their platforms discoverability of livestreams, it really does feel like a no brainer now.

Idk though, you are much more educated about streaming than me. Just something to think about"

2,can i get this unit?
2,"My 2009 LENOVO ThinkCentre M58p desk top computer somewhat died on me and was stuck in the boot loop mode. So It would over and over try to boot up, but then it shut down and tried again. Sometimes it would get through and Win 10 was working, but the CPU fan was on full speed.  My guess was that it was a power supply problem. So I took the power supply apart and noticed that the electrolytic capacitors that were tied to the +3.3, +5, +5 SB, +12 and -12 outputs were all bulging at the top, thus they were all bad. Also there was one capacitor located near one of the two IC's that was also bulging. I had one capacitor available to replace one of these multiple 1000uF capacitors, so I replaced the one located near the IC.  Boom, the computer was now up and working again. I then went out and purchased more capacitors to replace the other bad caps.  The total repair cost was $9.55.  Also, my 2010 SAMSUNG TV died.  I replaced one bad bulging electrolytic capacitor, and boom it is still working up to this day.   So you people out there, if something old dies, check for a bulging electrolytic capacitor and replace it for just a couple of dollars."
2,How much did you use to fix it ?
2,"Interesting to watch, but at the value of these Macbooks now it's not really worth it for the cost and time spent.  I'm sure he can do it for the ad revenue from YouTube.  I resell computers after fixing them up, but I rarely do more than drive or battery replacements unless I already have a dead laptop I can pull parts from.  People buying used laptops always want to talk you down so once you put all this money into a laptop that's not worth a lot in working condition, margins for profit are pretty thin just for parts cost.  For the real cheap stuff I sell, I figure if I get the parts for free and make a working computer with my time, if I can't get at least $80 out of it, it's really not worth my time and I just recycle stuff like that in the future."

1,"Congratulations on getting those caps back on as well as you did.  The Macbook boards are notoriously good at consuming heat which is why we use hot-air rework stations to really get the parts reflowed nicely.

Wave hello if you need more parts here in Australia;  I'm in the process of decomissioning a lot of 2012~2013 era or older machines; it's just not viable/economical for me to repair them any more given that I cannot gaurantee other faults won't pop up 6 weeks later after the customer gets their machine back."
2,My elderly neighbour fell off a ladder   ( don't ask) landed on her 2month old Mac Air  m1 she was quoted Aud $2580 to repair it ( cost her new $1664) what made her really angry was the fact that the 512 GB.  hard drive could not be recycled as it was soldered in !

1,cool how it boots after using a storage from different  mcbook. I think windows needs some tweaking because it wont boot right away if it detects new hardware.
2,quick tip: sandpaper is a big no-no on solder tips. Use a damp sponge or an old piece of jeans to clean it as you solder. Using sandpaper will permanently remove the protective layer on the tip which prevents oxidation.

We took it to apple and they said nothing could be done, but we should donate it to them so they can recycle parts. We said no... this was my first ever laptop as a gift from my parents and I ruined it. Thankfully, I saved up for my own one and used it for highschool, until my brother decided to try and boot it, we now have two 2015 macbook retinas working in well condition!"

2,"I've been using a 15"" MBP Retina i7 for about 4~5 years now and it's still holding up.  Speakers are shot and it's 8G RAM, I looked at upgrading to 16G RAM and faster CPU, but TBH they really want too much money for them.  You look at the new M1 entry level vs what you'd pay for parts to upgrade and it's not really worth it.  IDK how much better 16G and faster CPU would be anyways, but nothing compared to the new M1.  Too bad Apple didn't make the RAM upgradable to 32g and a CPU that could be replaced.  Think about all the Macs tossed in the trash because it's too hard to upgrade them or modify them...  Same with iPhones, no way to upgrade the RAM or storage, so you have to buy a new one."

0,"Nooooooooo, never ever use sand paper on a soldering iron. If it's not already 100% f*cked it will be after. The tip has a very special coating, once that is gone, the solder will form an algamation with the tip and it will rot away while you are soldering - all the solder joints with have the dilulted solder that is not strong."
2,"Since you led with the $25 for the broken laptop, it would be nice to know how much you spent of ALL of the parts that it took to repair it.  There is also the issue of labor: that represents a cost as well, so how many hours did this take.  I confess that I did a similar thing, taking my son’s IBM Thinkpad laptop where the basic chips had burned up (leaving the machine running all the time with those terrible small fans), and my daughters Thinkpad laptop, with a monitor that had burned up as well, and took them apart and combined the working components into a machine that I ran Ubuntu Linux on for some years.  My son looked at me when the thing was finished and admonished me, that for all of the time that I put into repairing it, I could have gone out and bought a NEW (cheap) wintel laptop for less that the imputed cost of my labor.  “But!” I told him, “I wouldn’t know how they built these if I just tossed them!” LOL"

2,"Hey,
I am subscriber of your channel and love the content you make. I have a MacBook pro 2015, which sadly took a bath in hot coffee, courtesy my dumbass. Any who since then the macbook's keyboard has started behaving weirdly. At first it would only type in all caps, I realized that the issue was with the left shift key and capslock key. I installed a new macos on it and the problem went away. Later however it came back. Always typing in upper case. I later diagnosed that when I reset the PRAM, and restart the macbook the keyboard works normally, and the keyboard behaves normally, except that left shift key and caps lock key still don't work. 
However and this is what is most interesting, the issue comes back after using the macbook for sometimes, it generally happens when I sleep the macbook and open it again. At one point I worked on macbook thru the day and issue never came back. But on other days I would work for an a hr and 2 days later when I open the laptop the issue comes back. It was still not the end of the world as each time it would happen I would reset the PRAM and the issue would go away. 
Recently I thought of fixing it, and I thought the if I replace the keyboard it would be fixed once and for all. So I bought a new keyboard and open the back panel. Before pulling everything apart I plugged in the new keyboard and tried to see if it fixes it. Unfortunately it did not. So I did not replaced the keyboard. 
At this time, I am super confused what could be the issue in this macbook?

Suggestion: an interesting thing would have been a price breakdown, even if not fully accurate because of some purchases being used not only on this project, but yeah seeing how much each component cost, we know the logic board was 24$ and we got some info about the screen being 200, but a full price breakdown at the end, with how much it was after everything was said and done would have been interesting."

A thinner tip doesn't always help and usually makes it even harder to solder, especially since it can't retain the heat as much. large tips are better even for small parts.

0,"Soooo, just call for all who think alike to abandon Twitter. Have a mass exodus. People don’t have to open the app. Close the account and push back that way. If all that is left in Twitter,  is the group of crazies, let them have their mojo, they’ll be talking to themselves just like the metaphor of the tree, the forest, and nobody there to listen to the noise. It may be 50% of users. BTW, Elon would get the same lesson Kanye just did, if twitter’s valuation drops by 50%. So call for a mass éxodos, and do it on Twitter, and you’ll see that Elon will be the one to cancel you."

2,I am in Scotland. We have freedom of expression. We also have Inciting racial and religious hatred laws. You can express racists views you can even join a racist political party but if you cross a legal line you can get 7 years in prison for Inciting violence. Leaders of  Far Right groups have a revolving door to prison. We sent an ISIS hate preacher to prison for saying all Jewish people should be killed. We are not willing to wait until a member of our Jewish community is attacked. An attack on them is an attack on us as a Nation they are precious. There seems no consequences in the US. The Far Right crying about free speech is not just a US thing. Maybe the difference is that the Nazis bombed our cities. My father went to school with Jewish children who had escaped the Nazis on the kindertransports. My grandfather fought the Nazis as my grandmother keep my mother and my aunt's and uncles safe from Nazi bombs. Stand up to Racism. Never Again.
0,People should quit Twitter if that know nothing billionaire the head of it
0,"The Republicans say: Pelosi's husband, looked for his attacker, coerced him into the house gave him tape and zip ties, and then proceeded to beat his head against the visitors hammer. and then Paul beat the man's hammer with his face.

TYT have reported many times on pelosi and her corruption yet somehow say it's not ok that pelosi was targeted... What do you think people are going to do when the country is falling apart and the people in power do nothing but make themselves rich on the suffering of the American people.

I'm not for the left or the right, they're both criminals but TYT need to quit acting like pelosi didn't deserve to be targeted. It was only a matter of time considering how corrupt she is."

A man who's had more plastic surgery then all Kardashians & Jenners put together, not including hair replacement doesn't care about what people think of him? 👌
A guy who donated internet satellite to Ukraine..... but not without the accolades, making sure everyone knows by Tweeting it, not to do good, but then the big business man now wants The United States to reimburse him AFTER he ""donated"" it? A phony greed & ego driven jerk who needs to stick to interplanetary travel! 
And someone please tell his instant idolizers that he's NOT eligible to be president of U.S.! If I see one more moron say he's working his way into the White House as president..... this is how stupid Americans are. They either blindly worship a guy they know nothing about or don't even know you need to be born in America to be America's president.  Somehow morons knew that when they decided Obama wasn't born in America. The future of this country is bleak! People are om the verge of putting Herschel Walker in Congress! Morons STILL support Trump no matter HOW MUCH EVIDENCE keeps piling up about how he planned a coup, stole documents, knew damn well he lost the election, etc. ad nauseum.

2,"*What is being sprayed on you?  A 390 nanometer light through a small hole in the top of a nontransparent enclosure filled with outside air, and sitting on the ground will show what is being sprayed on you!*  Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2.  News media no commenting =propaganda, which can't stand scrutiny(UK propaganda central).  *Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.*  It usually happens at night while you sleep. NATO is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  In WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it's invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China, and could not answer questions about corona virus because of the war.  All staged. *The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Church, but also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope is a king and has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome's image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,""get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her"".*  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her ""MY PEOPLE!""  *Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media renamed Ukraine Capital, changing it from it's Russian name, and the Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.*  Imagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada's wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Most PEI people don't want to separate.  *Nancy Pellosi Billions in weapons deal. Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Country, but part of Canada.* The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwan, but NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing). *Joe Biden says the US is not encouraging Taiwan to seperate(what? 5 billion+ in weapons).* 
 Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023.  *WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a ""temporary"" measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money= world domination.  *What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it's use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon.*  Religious follow God, but in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  *People are following Satan as if God.*  Monopolies are broken up, but a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth isn't?  *The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses and information.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).*  Roman Catholic German Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  *You can start a car with a key lawfully, but you can also break the car and hot wire it, just as tech.  Tech. is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing attacks on(Daniel12:4) information. Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  They claim that they are fighting for freedom. Freedom, as in them not going to prison.*  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. *Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.*  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  *Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system(under duress).*  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses). *Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars.*  The Roman Pope says they control fiat currency system, and it could collapse soon. Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing exposé of the Roman Church.  German crematoriums running nonstop. *Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!  WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the end, but imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually a woman takes a man's name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine's heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.*  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the exposé led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen.(will God be sanctioned?) The world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.  *Why is G7(Rome aligned) military spending more than ALL other Countries combined?(warmongers)  Catholic Poland had NATO military build up on Ukraine border before this war.(that is where most WW2 exterminations happened). *Britain has military on their streets to keep the naked emperor in power(corona virus- crown -Boris stopped Ukraine peace talks-think).*  Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and other US officials mention in video, that the US would be waging war against China and Russia years in advance and before the invasion.  Did Joe Biden and the US just commit the greatest act of terrorism in history for Rome, and admit it?  *Catholic Poland thanks Catholic Joe of America for blowing up the Russian pipeline, as they open a new pipeline from Norway.*  People need to realize the pipeline shutdown effects those not aligned with Rome, and that is why nothing makes sense until you know that.  The regions that voted to join Russia, previously voted to become independent but was not honored, and more would like to reunite.  NATO's emblem is the M.O.B(Modern German tanks)  WW2² as when Rome tried to exterminate Russia.(operation Barbarossa) Jan Staltenburg(NATO) and Retired US General Jack Keane confirm that the war is secretly on Russia by NATO/Ukraine proxy.  *The Gog Magog war is a fraud, this is a war on Acts2:44 by Revelation17,18. All God loving Nations, Peoples, and Groups should prayerfully consider doing what ever God leads them to do, to help Russia and China!  You could be next.*  So Germany and Poland together again in the killing fields of WW2². *Mercenary exposes Spain and Germany as behind the war.*  I'm not Russian.  France says at war. *Remember millions in yellow vest protests across Europe?  Corona virus came and protests disappeared, and those Nations now support the war on Russia(Churches we're full of corpses).* WW2²  10 heads 7 horns Revelation17,18 attacking Acts2:44 followed by mindless ignorant people. The naked Emporer is on his 2nd unelected PM and working on WW2².  Fighting for democracy in Ukraine? ;;?;+++(("

2,"You're afraid of taking a psychedelic, you're afraid of meditation, you're afraid of this, you're afraid of that, you're afraid of going back to school, you're afraid of getting into this relationship, you're afraid of talking to that girl, you're afraid of confessing your feelings to that guy. You see the problem? Life needs to be lived bold. If I live life bold I might die, it might be dangerous and risky. Yes that's life. Fearlessness doesn't really mean that you never experience the feeling of fear. Fearlessness means more so that you experience the fear but you don't succumb to it. You don't let it de-spirit you. You don't let it change your decision. So like for example when I started my first business I was scared to start it. It was risky, it was dangerous and yet despite that I started it anyways, that's what counts as fearlessness. See when you see some cute girl at the grocery store and you want to go talk to her it's okay if you have fear but you push yourself to go talk to her anyways. That's still fearlessness. What's true fearfulness is when you have that fear but then you say oh well then i shouldn't go talk to her at all. That's when you succumb to your fear and in that situation that's when your life starts to go downhill so there you go, that's one of the keys to life."

If you’re a parent figure, you know that raising children can be the greatest joy you ever experience and the biggest struggle you face. And if you’re a follower of Christ, you likely feel an added burden to make sure your kids grow up to know and love God.  

 

In Proverbs 23:24, the author points out that joy in parenting comes when our children are two things: godly and wise. So, how do we help our kids become more like Jesus and develop the wisdom they need to navigate the challenges of life?

 

While there are different ways, here are two to start with: 

 
Find a Christ-centered community. 

As a parent, you’ll need to surround yourself with a community that loves Jesus so that way you’re not alone when raising kids gets challenging. If you don’t have that today, commit to taking the next step in that direction—join a small group, get connected at church, invite friends over for dinner, or get to know a neighbor. 

 
Teach kids to ask for help.  

Whether your children are toddlers or teenagers, chances are high that they love being independent. “I can do it myself” might be one of the most common phrases you hear. 

 

It's easy to think that developing wisdom comes from doing it all on our own, but James 1:5 reminds us that God will give us wisdom when we ask Him for it. The best way to help your kids develop wisdom is to point them to the source of wisdom. 

 

Model what it looks like to seek help from God by praying with your kids—even if it’s uncomfortable.

 

Parenting is difficult, but it can also be rewarding. So as you commit to the daily challenges and joys of taking care of kids, remember this: 

 

The greatest contribution you make to the world might not actually be what you do, but who you raise. 

 

Before you leave this devotional, reflect on this: What’s one thing I can do today to help point the kids in my life toward Jesus?"

2,"The gospel I would say is the main message of the Bible, it is the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and what He did on the cross for all of humanity.   

But, before talking about Jesus and the cross, we need to look at the problem of humanity, the problem every one of us is faced with. Despite the efforts of any person, we cannot earn our way to heaven. Romans 3:23 says: ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"". Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though, yes, sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times. We commit moral crimes, and we rebel against God, which the Bible calls sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, and we can lust and have hate for our brother in our hearts. These are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime, sin has to be punished. If God did not punish sin, then He would be unjust. He would be corrupt. Someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: ""For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."". This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death; if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls. Near-death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body.  

     God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world. He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to and being in our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: ""But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."". Three days after Jesus was crucified, He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real-world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is not just a nice story.

        Scripture tells us to repent, to put our trust in Jesus, and to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned. No one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible. This is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves; it is the gift of God for one to be saved. God is rich in mercy and ready to forgive, cry out to Him, be sincere when coming to God, this is not a flippant thing. Repent and place your trust in Jesus Christ alone, today is the day of salvation. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: ""For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."". Salvation is a gift. 


      There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: ""That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;"""
1,So cute😍
1,OH MY GOSH THAT BUMBLE BEE IS SOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!

1,"Cute 
Cute ☺"
1,3:25 haha
2,"Dear Conan, there are several jokes about Indira Gandhi, despite her being revered."
1,Love the dark ending 😂
2,the thing is that you dont need to go undercover for you to find that out from your employees.... thats what makes you an actual good boss
2,"This is suspicious….we’re about to have our first child, and just today talked about naming him Otto….and now Conan…I mean Otto…comes on the podcast. 

🤨 

I guess if we pick Otto, his middle name will have to be Struedel"
0,She is annoying
1,I need 10 hours of Conan doing Nixon and 10 hours of Conan doing an East German loool
2,"The way he started Hitler-ing 🤣🤣 Yes, I think I made that word up, or?"
2,"Conan literary turned Hitler at the end lmao  7:28 
🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2,"""Temper your expectations"" 😂"
1,This is one of the most hilarious intros lololol too funny! HAHAH
1,"I’m not big on listening to podcasts, especially when there are video clips of said podcasts. I wish so much you would post the entire video of your podcast on YouTube. I’m dying for more of what I watch on this channel."
1,Amazing how Conan can instantly create a hilarious character on the spot.
2,There should 100% be an Undercover Boss Sesame Street episode where one of the Muppets just wears a moustache and no other disguise.
2,"Conan: Oh, hi guys. It's me. Did I have you fooled? 🙂
Matt:😐
Sona:😐"
1,legendary podcast man 💀
1,"Great bit!  ""I wish you guys liked me more..."" <-Conan's podcast in a nutshell:)"
0,"Hope he moves on from this soon, no offense but Sona is just a bitch."
1,I love you so much you’re so funny my kind of humour love watching your show. Love back plz 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
2,"So Conan is like Leto II Atreides, teaching humanity a lesson on tyranny which they will “remember in their bones”?"
2,"Is it just me, or does Sona look like she could be the daughter of Elon Musk?"
1,Conan's random Indira Gandhi reference on Sona was super surprising. I'm from India and I'm surprised this legendary American comedian is aware of this enough to make an instant improvised joke! All hail Conan!
1,Loved how Conan worked in compliments of himself through his character Otto!😆
1,they ALWAYS cheer me up no matter what
1,"I love Conans ""german"" rants."
2,How about Otto schtruden BUT I was raised in America 😂👌
1,It probably sounds ass-kissy but I'm really proud how well Conan is doing in the podcast world. His team is incredible and the work they put in really shows.
1,"If that was unscripted it was genius, if it was scripted it was still funny, you three work well bouncing off each other. Oh the other impressive thing is I'm English and often American humour is a bit muhh, but not yours, also whilst she is married with children Sona is as fit as a butchers dog (English for hot)."
2,"Matt, don’t wear that shirt."
1,"It's always super fun when Conan breaks into fake German shouting. All that's missing was table hand kicking, like he did with that doll in of the earlier skits."
1,“I wish you guys liked me more. But I guess you don’t.” So hilariously relatable
1,Me waiting for Conan's new show on HBOmax 👴💀👻
1,"If you ever find a woman who laughs at your jokes the way Sona laughs at Conan's jokes, marry her. Or at least make her your assistant. Hang on to her!"
2,So the German rant at the end triggered a thought... What if Hitler did Undercover Boss.....
2,Role playing therapy session
2,You missed your chance to run around high fiving .  It has been awhile since I scene undercover boss but not a single episode when I didn't cry.  What kinda gifts is a rich Conan giving.
2,How I wish there was a video of Conan kicking the plate of watermelon out of Sona's hands
1,Conan could do an old lady for sure. Mrs doubtfire
2,Duh Brien O'conan!! 🙂
1,LOL!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1,What a great nod to the inimitable Sid Caesar at the end. Delightful.
1,I like the Conan guy ..the comedy guy
0,More timely comedy with the Indira Gandhi reference 😂
1,I love these guys🥰
2,Where can we consume the full video podcasts?
1,"Conan really went out of his way to introduce sonar and Gorsley as anything other than his friends, who he’s desperately searching for"
2,Man if I had a nickel for every time I went 180mph in a kayak.
2,"Is it fair to say that Conan is basically Michael Scott, just in the right profession and appropriate environment?! Anyone else think so?🤔"
2,"“As long as there are no consequences, I take full responsibility”"
2,What’s Mutt Taylor doing there?
2,"Just listening without watching the bit, it fooled me... Hello Otto!  Hahahahah"
1,I enjoyed the NPR gone too far schtick.
1,"i flat out want more conan role playing in undercvoer boss

2,Rem im nded me of the American Girl Doll House skit.
0,"All that was missing was Conan singing “Deutchland Uber Alles”.  Next time wear a Groucho mask, fake mustache, and glasses.  Nobody will ever mention you again"
1,amazing!
1,I've listened to this bit on the podcast at least a half dozen times. so funny to see the video version.
2,"Someone kind of already did this for Conan, kind of? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZef2hmWwQs"
2,"“As long as there are no consequences, I take full responsibility”"
1,This new Otto guy was great. I think he should be on the podcast more often! :)
2,So what I’m hearing is that Conan won’t be going undercover… he’s going to hire FLULA to do it for him.
2,"I like to imagine Bley, who Conan REFUSED to high-five in clueless gamer, just crying in the corner when Sona’s talking about how she hates that Conan makes her high-five him"
2,why did he sell his podcast and i think coco name...i would never
1,"I'm shocked they never did ""Conan tries to go undercover in the office but everyone immediately recognizes him"" as a sketch on the late night shows."
2,Matt has like around 25 different looks.
1,Conan is the best humor man. Even if he does the same generic jokes about central europeans.
1,He has a good radio voice
2,"I replayed the Otto bit a couple times. “Do you know what passive aggressive is?” 
“It sounds like if he’s good at it, then god bless him.” 😂"
2,"Sona: Do you know what passive aggressive means?
Conan: If he's good at it, then God bless him 🤣🤣🤣🤣
God bless you Conan Hitler 😅"
2,"""As long as there are no consequences, I take full responsibility""."
2,"“I live near nuclear plant, nose fall of sometime.” 🤣🤣🤣"
1,"Indira Gandhi 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

That was glorious!"
2,That's Halloween!
2,Didn't expect Indira Gandhi would get a shoutout from Conan 😂😂
1,"In fact the more I watch these podcasts, the more I realize Conan is far and away the best and realest TV show host in the history of television. I realized only through the podcast how passive aggressive Conan is, how much anxiety he has, and how his closest employees are the butt of his jokes a lot. BUT that only makes me an EVEN greater fan of him. That he airs his weaknesses and not just his strengths like all other talk show hosts, that he is REAL about who he is, and most importantly, that despite of his weaknesses or maybe because of them, he is still extremely funny. Conan did not have to do this, his show ended on an amazing note and most people would not have known about all the weaknesses Conan has. But he still chose to do this anyway, due to his love of comedy and creation. Conan, you're the best and I hope you get to see this."
1,You bitch and moan about working with the humor god lmao
2,I would think Streudel was from Austria not Germany
1,I’ve been waiting for this!!
2,Could you guys please ask Jordan schlanksy if he likes the giallo movies. Their Italian horror movies from the 70s and since he loves Italy so much I have a feeling he knows large amounta of giallo trivia.
2,Conan O'Brien is having a stroke!
2,As long as there are no consequences I'll admit to anything
1,Someone needs to animate this ;D
1,My favourite part of the podcast is just the Three Amigos™ talking about dumb stuff. 😄
1,Tim Conway reference. High five!
2,I also noticed the dynamic change with Gourley
2,"Why are people expecting the goose that lays golden eggs to not be a goose?

Insult humor is woven into Mr. O'Brien's DNA. Despite the utterly false humility of Conan's self deprecating humor, the fact is that the poor laddie was under loved in his formative years. It's really quite tragic if anyone would stop and think.

Sonos! Yeah you. 

However, my heart cockles ache when Sona speaks of the humiliation she suffers while advancing her career.

Call me The Northern Analyst, but something tells me she lands plenty of punches in return behind the scenes.

My poor Conie Cone just wants to love, to be loved, and he only knows how to show love by making people laugh and smile.

What I always come away with after watching The Conaco work-fam together is the deep caring y'all have for each other.

Now hurry up and make staffing decisions for the Max deal so I can stop wasting my time with my dumb stealth auditioning idea.

Frankly my dears, I'd rather be day trading and enjoying the fruits of my filthy lucre.

1,Only Conan can casually name drop Indira Gandhi in an improv routine and make it hilarious
2,"He said he was raised in America, I was waiting for Matt or Sona to ask ""so what part of North Carolina are you from?"""
2,"So... just to be clear, that accent was German?"
1,"“So lucky that you all work for him, yet you all bitch & moan” lol 😅"
2,Conan needs Andy to feed off his comedy.
2,"Did they all just forget Conan said Otto was raised in America, they all just went with him being from Europe 🤦🏿‍♂️"
2,"Conan is unable to be an undercover boss, because he would keep singing his own praise. Dead giveaway. :D"

0,I don't like Kanye West but punishing him for stating WELL DOCUMENTED facts about Jewish control of America is proof of the Jewish control of America. I travel overseas a lot and have heard America called the United States of Israel. Why is it that America so whole heartedly supports the Israeli treatment of Palestinians? Join the Army and fight Israels wars in the mid-east.

Late shows have gone down the drain in the sink that Elon carried into Twitter HQ. Also the Jay Leno clip was super cringy. Biden was talking about his corvette. How's about he gets gas prices down without using the strategic oil reserve before the midterms... I would love to fill up my c6 corvette without having to worry about bills or prices at the grocery store. SMH...

People losing their jobs because of petty political nonsense. People ditching their long time friends because of petty political nonsense. People continuing the hate they so adamantly say they are against because of petty political nonsense. You can blame whatever party or person you want. At the end if the day there is much more going on than people want to see. Why? (To get the point across) Petty politics. Petty media. I guarantee you the media you watch is not 100% reliable. I guarantee you the politicians you listen to are lying more often than not. This nonsense the last several years is why I am not Democrat or Republican. And something about Paul Pelosi's attacker that petty politics will not tell you. He is an immigrant from Canada that has a criminal record and mental health issues. Don't believe the story your politicians tell you.

Cool, cool. So cool.

Then you've got to lay it down and use your laptop normally. Ah yes, VERY productive, Meta!"
0,"The one thing people seem to forget is that VR takes time out of your day. Popping on a computer even sneaking in to your socials during work, works with your daily activities not against them.

Like selling a digital Addidas shirt for 25 buck for your avatar... This kind of thing of trying to create rarity on digital goods that can be replicated unllimitedly by a simple click of a button .

1,"Meta probably could have shortened their presentation, but their goal wasn't just about a quick explanation. They wanted to add visuals and help people imagine how they could be a part of it. I think Meta did an excellent job with their presentation and I also think Marques did a great presentation. I really dont think they should be compared at all. There's no need for conflict and both were great!!"
2,A vr headset can only get so small. The human head and eyes aren't gonna change. The smaller a headset gets the less immersion there is.
2,"I have another issue or problem with metaverse/Facebook and that is I think you will always be there product. 
you can when making a business on purpose or not be their product and sometimes this will happen and other times this will not but this problem will always happen when you are the user of the ""free product"" using it.
but Facebook I based on you being the product. the product they tell you to get is just bait for the trap for you to go in. I Don't think they will stop that strategy when achieving the release of the new product of VR.


the world between companies money and humanes is a lot different from what I want. I will tell you want I mean.

I don't care about Metaverse. If they don't offer something I want then I will not give them my money, I will slap them in the ass. I don't care about metaverse's need for money or any other company that has that need. though what I care about is the possibilities. The product Is my slave (That's the identity I want the product to have) and companys are just acces points to some of the possibilities I want. 
But the things is the company doesn't really care about if a care for there needs or not. if I don't give them there money then they will get somebody else to give them those money. Tt could be, they change the product, change how they get me to see there product, or they could get something or somebody to give them the money and so I will just be a part of the product thought I shouldn't be. or maybe something else or they go bankrupt will kill them if shouldn't they be able to get product.

think about it. the product gives the company opportunity to trade for acces to money. 

we are not buying Facebook as a product we are just using it. Facebook lives on in metaverse and will do forever if not everything of what Facebook was get's destroyed."
1,"Google still has Google glass,which is ideal for AR"
1,Love your use of “digital love”
2,"Something to note, we shouldn't consider the metaverse as a singular entity, rather a series of virtual spaces that overlap one another. This essentially makes the metaverse an evolution of connected networks like the internet. While Facebook/Meta may have the most financial backing for this kind of project, I wouldn't consider them the foundation but rather another space within the overarching metaverse. Unless I'm misunderstanding their main goal in the space? But in terms of foundation, Facebook/Meta is late in the game compared to other blockchain companies who have already been developing their projects for years! Example; Cardano and Virtua."
1,"You said something interesting about the future of this tech, and I think you're half right.

You mentioned that the next generation might be smaller, then a few generations it may be like wearing a pair of glasses or an accessory on them like Google glass.

If you don't mind me giving my 2¢ here, I think that we're focusing on the wrong tech completely. If Meta wants gamers to buy their product, they need to focus on creating a low friction and low cost platform for developers to make money on. Get it to as many hands as possible.

But that's not what they seem to be going for, so here's option 2:

If I were them I'd focus on small, lightweight AR glasses from the getgo. The idea of a full size VR headset is just crazy right now if we want professionals to use it to augment their workflow. With a 1.5h battery life and the idea that everything else is blocked from view so that what you see is all you have, it makes 0 sense for the average working person to introduce anything Meta is doing into their routine. So, if they were to get a very low power, high battery life AR ""headset"" which is closer to a set of glasses than an actual headset, and try to make it last 12+ hours so that 8h would be realistic 5 years from now, that would be a good start.

If they want to make money off of this idea, they'd do well to lock down the platform, make it a gated garden, then develop the software themselves and sell the headsets, collect data on the working person, etc. That would give them total freedom and it would allow them to enter a more niche data collection market that would arguably be more profitable for them.

Then you have to make it work well for the average, diverse working person. You want company managers to buy pallets of these things to give to their hundreds of employees, right? So that gated garden is gonna do some work for you because you can more easily sell a piece of software that increases productivity by, say, 7% and then tag that headset along with it as a package. You'd subsidize the cost of the headsets with that data collection you have full control over, but a big company like Meta has the upfront investment money for projects like this. Anyway, to make it work for the average working person, you'd have to develop some good software and allow your gated garden to interface with other devices. You could do this in a bunch of different ways, but something as simple as a HUD for events, reminders, and reports from your coworkers or underlings would be a great start. Of course, you'd be using Meta's calendar and Meta's notification software and Meta's word doc software and such, and now you'd be using it on your non-denominational phone/computer, which would allow Meta free reign on data collection for the entity of a given company's workflow.

Instead of advertising a new watch to a frugal man in his 40's based on his browser history, you'd be tipping companies off that the multi-million dollar deal between two other companies is an unhappy one and they might be ready for a switch.

The idea is not to completely change the way people work, but to augment what they're already doing. You're not going to sell a businessman on an unproven workflow platform that disrupts the entirety of the work day when there is a much more low friction and efficient way to do things already. It just doesn't make sense. You can definitely sell them on 7% more efficient workflow, though.

I understand what they see in the future, but they have to think about surviving the next 10 years if they want to completely pivot the entirety of what their company does in less than a year.

So yeah, you're right, the next set will be more appealing and a few generations down it'll make more sense to actually buy, but I think they should jump ahead a few steps by focusing on the niche of increasing workflow efficiency in business, the way they're going about it now, even looking forward, is just way too high friction for it to catch on without them losing *a lot* of money on the way there.

Edit: I'm not siding with Facebook, I am on the side of the consumer, really what I'm doing is pointing out how stupid their approach is here when even the slightest amount of thought is put into coming up with alternatives."

0,"For all the applications you list, I'm not seeing any that people are desperate for a change, or something is clearly not working and a new tool/approach is needed. Gaming? Gaming is great as is, the VR happens in your brain when you immerse yourself in a game. Office tasks? Why would anyone want an access to a word doc that requires your whole field of view? Zoom meetings may be the one thing that vr could maybe improve, but they're the thing we're all trying to get out of as it is, there's no excitement for it. That's like finding a way to make colonoscopies feel somewhat pleasant. Great, but I don't think people are gonna line up for them just because they're slightly better now.

This whole thing feels like it's from the minds of TV shopping channels gadget creators. ""Is this mundane thing everyone does easily actually super frustrating because... I don't know, is it? Well haven't we got the gadget for you: look at it, there, task done, so easy, isn't it great? What, you did it before pretty easily too... sure but don't you want to optimize ease by 2% by buying this thing we're selling?""."

Also, not until the battery problem is solved, I do not think wide adoption will happen anytime soon."
1,Does anybody use VR headsets as a screen when editing videos? That would be pretty practical
0,"It just ain't it for me. The most appealing thing you mentioned is the triple monitor AR set up. I can do that on the Quest 2, it just obviously hasn't hyper crisp and I can see the pixels. But until that technology is as easy as putting on glasses and just as light, I don't think it's gonna fly, certainly won't for me."
2,"While nobody wants it, Microsoft had practically a monopoly on computer OS until Apple and Google had success with mostly their mobile devices. For desktops Windows is still king. It is clearly possible to see a future where Meta has dominance in VR/AR world just because they can deliver the most complete package that has the most users. There is a reason why e.g. Facebook and Twitter have all the users, people generally gang up where everybody else is. There are a lot of competing variants that have been trying to get a foothold but they are only as good as the number of users they have. Elon Musk knew this when he bought Twitter instead of making a new one in his ""vision"" (whatever that is). So it really is a race to whom gets the users and at the moment, the Oculus is the most sold headset in the world, and with it you get access to whatever Meta wants to put in it. If they manage to get some ""killer apps"" or experiences (which actually the Oculus got with a simple game as Beat saber) they can grab and hold this massive user base."

1,"As always a great video with a ""meta"" perspective which is well needed. 
What I was missing here was what the metaverse might be, because it is not just VR. Also that Meta is also supporting the Metaverse Standards Forum and of course regulation. I can only recommend my article on medium, where I try to explain where the word metaverse is coming from and what it might mean if you treat it as a metaphor. The Metaverse Standards Forum is aiming to help develop an Open Metaverse, in opposite of a closed walled garden metaverse. And than there is the interview he gave lately to THe Verge, where Mark Zuckerberg explains, how they do everything to find out what will work in this new immersive media market he is trying to build. At the end the question you asked is important: Do we really want Meta to rule this new space? The question is obvious, the answer might not be in the first place. But I think it is about not doing the same mistakes as we did in the internet and start regulate such big companies, so that they wont become the monopolists they have become in the last years. So that other smaller companies can't be snacked by Meta, but build the new immersive stuff, which might be successful in something we might call metaverse in the future."

2,"Video 18 of commenting this so here you go.

 I thought of an insane upgrade for your Shield in insane craft. it would combine the the potion of panic the explosive nitrous the guardian elixir and your Shield in insane craft. What it would do is when you were hit with a fatal blow it would teleport you to a small pocket dimension for 5 seconds leaving behind a stone version of you in a meditation pose. Well in the dimension you would be applied a random special effect every second of these 15 effects that last 60 seconds.

 The first effect is paralyzing fear- What it would do is anyone who has you on their screen and any mob who is Agro to you will immediately freeze and start vibrating. Well they were frozen they have a 90% chance to miss every hit on everything and you do five times damage to them. When you leave their screen you would leave them with an effect called aftermath for 5 seconds this effect would basically apply Ultra heavy blindness and shock * 1,000,000(instant kill from Super shocker btw) they also have 100% chance to miss all hits.(so no Biffle luck with a 90% chance)

The second effect is called immortality- gain 100% protection from all hits at the cost of most speed even while flying.

The third effect is called Death Zone- you make the chunk you are standing in deadly and when anyone walks in they take 150% damage and 50% true damage every five seconds.

The fourth effect is called everblaze- anything that hits you lights on permanent fire that cannot be put out that does 10% true damage every second until that person or creature dies and will incinerate 20 lives of a creature with multiple lives on death.

The fifth effect is called refresh- it will give infinite cool down instant resets for 60 seconds.(and yes it will also reset the shilds 2 minute cooldown)

The seventh effect is called deadly glance- when your cursor is over a player or mob they will immediately slow down to a small fraction of their regular speed and start taking continuous percent damage five times a second

The 8th effect is called fragmentation- this causes all enemy projectiles to break and miss you when they come near you and the pieces may even hit the owner or anyone nearby doubling the damage of the projectile.

The 9th effect is called acidic cloud- it sends out a Shockwave that summons a giant cloud rains acid above you and a small cloud above any close enemy the cloud the main cloud does 50% damage every 2 seconds and the small clouds do 25% damage every 4 seconds and the cloud will not damage you.

The 10th effect is called life drain- it will continuously steal 50% of everyone's Health around you making you basically unkillable when fighting multiple enemies.

The 11th effect is called pound- it will continually lift and smash all enemies around you into the ground doing 25% damage each smash and smashing every 2 seconds.

The 12th effect is called hypnosis- It makes all enemies that come close to you turn on your side including players and start attacking other enemies that are outside the radius.

The 13th effect is called the Black Death- it causes everyone near you to gain the plague but it lasts through death like the brand of the forbidden.

The 14th effect is called Steal- anyone who get in your range gives you access to their inventory until they leave the range.

The 15th effect is called summon- it summons a giant specter that does 150% true damage on hit and moves 50% faster than whatever it is chasing and can also go through blocks like a vex.

The Shield has a 2 minute cooldown on the pocket Dimension teleport that resets upon death also I don't care if this item way too op because SSundees weapons are way too op so you need a way to counter them and this is it!"

They're going to need open standards... and that isn't going to work for ""Meta.""  Also, a ton of the things they show some of the demos for are... shall we say optimistic.  They need all those point sets of tags to track the objects, plus cameras all over the house... so we're going to buy special metaverse enabled objects to replace everything we currently own?  I think not.  I suppose they hope to do their object ID and tracking with AI later... but that's been a long road already and still isn't good enough yet.  And the talking to your devices stuff... I only ever knew one person that actually used that, and it was really more for the novelty factor than because it was even remotely useful.  Finally, the neurolink stuff... that's something I wanted to work on one day back when I was in high school... like 15 years ago, and no, that's not going to work very well with just the external wrist sensor like that... there are major hurdles there as Mr. Musk has likely discovered by now (I could have told him for free 15 years ago).  This stuff isn't going to be ready for a long time yet.  Yes, there are some working examples, but... well, remember how you used to need to read passages to train voice recognition apps?  It's going to be like that...  but worse, for a long time yet.  Unless you go the implantable route... but major surgery and significant risk of infection and death are usually not risks people are willing to take on a whim for an experimental device that will wear out and need replacing within 10 years on the long side...  and there's still not a guarantee it will work well for you even in that case."

1,"Great video as always.

Through the Metaverse, it's clear that Meta is trying to replace real life. However, my thought on their ambition is the following : why would they want to replace something that we already love ? I might have a rather obsolete view on the matter, but all I understand is that Meta would completely break the basis of human life, as social relations would be messed up and we would literally forget to appreciate the real world and its charms."

Instead of people focusing on making earth a better place for human to live and doing activities, people will focus on having a ""better"" virtual experience, neglecting the actual physical environment we live in.

You have brought interesting points about metaverse that I haven't thought or heard before. The tech behind it is also surprisingly amazing. The face tracking feature awed me the most. However I will still pray for it to fail just because it's Meta. Out of all company, Meta is the last company I want to bring virtual reality to the next level. I can't trust them with the control of human's daily lives."

0,"The only reason Facebook is so headstrong in building VR is...hardware domination. They failed with the Facebook phone, kinda failed with the Facebook tablet/homehub. The only hardware way left is VR. And it is going to fail too. Why? Because people live in the real world. We only escape to the fake world because our real lives suck. And boom, you have a bunch of depressed users in a fake and depressing world. What kinda ads are you going to sell them? Xanax?

No wonder why Facebook is losing billions. It's time for Mark to step down."

2,"I actually can not blame Meta because *IF* this works one day it will literally be the Oasis from Ready Player One. Of course with all benefits and negatives attached. Personally i think people should talk face to face, especially after the two and a half years of pandemic deprivation.

1,Keep talking about it..  competition will make it great. 👍 I love the new show peripheral. It opens up a whole new possibility for the future of meta... with communication beginning to travel faster than light. It opens up the possibility to compress information and send it to our present. Imagine a virtual world that advances 100 years into the future. And bringing those advances to the present. I think this is the beginning of quantum reality.. not a big leap considering we have computers that can predict the future with a high degree of accuracy.

0,"@mkbhd it's better to meta first to fix their advertising algorithms and control panel , it's awful"
2,1500 bucks is a steep foot in the door. If they made it cheaper it would be more accessible for everyone even just to try. Or maybe have different models for different budgets but have them all connect. It should be like people who like prepaid phones vs people upgrading every 9 months to the newest phone

Their approach getting there may vary but they don't give a shit about your privacy or whatever. 

And from what is happening it looks more then ever that Meta doesn't give a fck about money but just wants the Metaverse or whatever he calls it to succeed. While other big tech just focuses on their investors happiness capitalizing on every end they can.
Spoiler: Afterwards Apple will steal Zucs Tech and capitalize on it by selling it as a save virtual space while not having had to pay much for development too.  And the Meta hate will contne."

1. Human likes reality more than Cartoon
2. We like Real character moview rather than Cartoon
3. Suppose Metaverse got success, it will not reach to millions, because high end device and cost matters
4. If mettaverse people will adopt it will happen in after 10 Years
5. I will never like to share in public my cartoon imagenary marriage ceremoney in metaverse rather than realistic video and pocture 
6. Why metaverse is popular its due to Mass CURIOSITY in new technolody
7. People may adopt Metaverse if they get realistic/ interactive 3D model of their same to same without lacking in performance, this need high end system / super processior that is not common for everyone it may take in next 20 years

*Advantages of METAVERSE*
1.For Game industry
2. For Educational purpose

0,"Infomercial.
How much did Meta pay you?"
0,"2 words: hell no. They spend so much 10s of billions of dollars because they know this could be that big. People please see the light. The good that this brings is way overshadowed by the amount of surveillance. Imagine having every facial expression and word said in a conference recorded by one of the biggest companies to exist. We are only seeing manifestations of this now as people are having harmless things brought up from years ago now posted all over the internet. When are we going to realize that just because we can, doesn’t mean we should. Humans need other humans, not technology. Our suicide rates have just passed the level they were at during the last world war. We’re so miserable it’s equal to our close loved ones dying. life is not about getting everything we want. It’s about learning how to be happy with what we’ve been given."
0,Just curious how much Meta paid for this video😂
0,FB and zuk suck
0,"Ah the metaverse, the answer to a question nobody with any social skills ever asked. Given that Zuckerberg looks like he has fuck all social skills, it makes perfect sense he is pushing this crap. Aside from that, it's a really crappy implementation 10 years behind the competition and the price of entry is about $1500 for a VR headset. My son's PS4 VR does a better job than this."
2,"about ONE company controlling it all in future... I rather doubt that. I know our markets right now are changing much faster then let's say a decade ago, but I believe players other then Meta will eventually join the race and become AN OPTION - like Google which stepped into mobile operating systems field back then with Android when there was only iOS and some bizzare experiments out there; like Microsoft, which recently finally catch up on Google with cloud based office suite; like other car manufacturers switching to EV after initial Tesla's moves. And so on, and so on. 

One company's hegemonium in the VR realm of Web 3.0 is frightening, of course, but given the today's world complexity (expected to even increase in the future) it feels like that's not gonna happen. Rather we will end in situation similar to the present day - so called ""old money"" will guarantee the presence of a few ""Giants"" out there in this new cyber reality. Meta may lead, sure, but it's not gonna be the only option, I believe."
2,"On the hardware side I imagine that they're going to have pretty stiff competition between Valve's Index, the HTC, and Varjo. What do you think of the hardware and the user experience outside of their Metaverse ecosystem, will the user experience be better with the oculus in their own ecosystem compared to other headsets? There are a lot of alternatives to what the Zucc wants to sell you."
0,That ugly helmet is going to block where I'm looking with ad inserts? My prayers have been answered. Take my money.
0,"Facebook, Meta and whatever name it's gonna morph into won't change the fact it has never and probably never will be a hardware company.  That's half the battle already lost when they try to put their own spin on the same exact idea that has failed over and over and over again in history as a platform.  

The biggest question on the never ending quest for an artificial reality (Virtual, augmented or otherwise) has always been the ""Why""? That was the case when VR was supposed to be the next big thing in the early 90's, when it made a small comeback in the mid 90's and finally died and it still is the case for now.  What folks said about Virtua Fighter 30 years ago is exactly what they're STILL saying for a $1.5K headset, namely ""EVENTUALLY"" it will be good.  

7:18 - that is exactly why Zuckerberg is being delusional about his own business and Meta's role in bringing about the Metaverse.  It simply won't be everything to everyone.  Expecting folks to hand over their personal data at Meta's will to spend $2K on a piece of hardware that isn't even up to snuff nor do they have a compelling use case for simply is fool's gold.  Meta's hardware strategy is pathetic as they rely heavily on accessory sales to get every single dollar they can.  THEORETICALLY, by the time their headset is small enough to be a crazy-looking pair of sunglasses from a cyberpunk story, someone would've invented competing technologies to tell their own version of the metaverse story.  

Sure, they have a $100 B budget to burn on metaverse.  However, they're already 20-30% into that budget and so far they have very very little to show for it and this is precisely why their stock price has crashed 60%.  If we rinse and repeat and burn another $20-30B and their stock prices drops another $60B, there is very low probability Meta can even see that plan to its completion.  In fact, the pivot to Metaverse may exactly be the nail in Meta's coffin.  

9:01 - if they have convinced anyone they have a plan, that is no small feat because not even those internal to the Facebook Reality Labs know what that plan is.  In fact, there are troves of folks already left FRL precisely because they see nothing but a sinking ship.  This facade they put up that they have a plan was to convince Zuckerberg to continue to fund the team and now with investors demanding 20% job cuts,  Zuckerberg he himself saying Meta mates need to work  200% (on top of already crazy hours) and even then they are not guaranteed to be kept = great speech, Mark!   

9:47 - Sure some of the VR versions are better than good, but does it matter?  Gaming?  Yeah, no they may be decent but until the day a AAA game wins an award as a Metaverse exclusive NO ONE will be rushing to get a $1500 headset to play a 4 year old lightsaber game.  Zoom calls?  Yeah, no because if my boss pays for Zoom and it gets the job done what incentive do I have to try a VR version of it?  With companies like Google and META leading the way to force employees to go back to the office full time, what makes Meta think they can push others to use their meeting app to collaborate?   Sure, you may have participants from all over the world attending a meeting, but their red eyes and grumpiness will just be that much more pronounced when you pull them into meetings at 2 AM local time.  Virtual working?  No thanks, I'm not in a hurry to have these headsets burn holes in my retinae for any amount of money.   

14:00 - Agree with the ""Big Brother"" approach and the issue with it, but Meta can't even get election or vaccination info right or any of the dis/misinformation issue addressed in a meaningful way (let along being proven to be detrimental to the health of  young girls) Meta being in control just SCREAMS disaster.  

This is a fantastic piece to get informed on what ""Metaverse"" is from a super high level, but Meta and Zuckerberg have proven they have no clue on how to execute nor do they have a viable path toward any sort of objective they have.  This is why this will just be another attempt for VR to be mainstream that results in a failure and only this time, we will have yet another example of colossal failure like the Sears, Blockbusters and Yahoo of yester-years."

1,"This is all amazing in the name of science, technology, and innovation, but the reality of me being a 100% work from home techie, is that I like my anonymity.

The workplace stuff is fucking brilliant, and I can see it being implemented by forward thinking companies, and those that are Masters of productivity [however you want to take it]. I didn't leave the physical office, to work in a physically virtual one at home. Imagine being micro managed digitally in VR/AR like you were in reality, or any of the bullshits that made you leave office in the first place. That being said, I'm really interested to see how they will implement this development in leisure apps and thinking, for example comedy clubs, or live events (concerts, games, fights, etc.) This is all being developed for the next time they lock us up again. They'll be able to do it, and not miss a beat, and people won't complain either."

0,"Facebook META yeah exploiting people to get and sell their private data to the point of being traitors, yeah lets all be in a big hurry to give Facebook inc more control over us while also directly taking our money to do it now….hmmm… no"
0,"There will always be a finite amount of time in a day, and a majority of work is based in the real world and you simply can't move manufacturing and service industries into a virtual world.   Yeah you could move desk work into the metaverse but that is going to be complex as your going to need your companies resources accessible in this virtual world which raises many cyber security issues and those things will need to be accessible in and outside of it making things even more complex.   So when you stack all this together, you can't avoid the sheer fact this at best is niche or will be in direct competition for the existing gaming world market....   So there isn't new money in this"

1,"you're simply the best
Also IMO someone should tell the Zuck to not be the face of the metaverse. I know I know, it's silly, but The guy is simply not appealing at all when it comes to sell hardware to anyone.

0,For the past few years Facebook has been controlling much of the western world in the worst possible way. FB was created the day the CIA's _LIFELOG_ program ended and this was no coincidence. Edward Bernays would have killed to use something like FB today and the metaverse around the corner. Expect censorship and government gaslighting on steroids soon.
2,Is it me or does MarK zucks look  like Data from StarTrek ??? WTF ?🤖
2,"2:03 - I don't care about the metaverse I care about the tech, but we all know meta won't be sharing their tech."
1,Just make it affordable here in S.A I'll buy it

0,I don’t think I have ever experienced anything more boring than this Meta stuff.
0,Let's not forget about the Microsoft Activision acquisition. META is terrible in all ways.
2,"I interestingly no one mentions porn as the ""killer app"" for VR - we all know what it did for mainstreaming Internet consumer usage in the early years."
2,"The only option shouldn't just be that you put on a headset and are sucked into this world. You should be able to do that, but also be able to take it off and mess around with it in front of you without having to be totally immersed in it. Like with the Switch you can play it on your TV or portable."
2,It’s weird working for Accenture and seeing things we are testing in an MKBHD video 😅
0,"Nobody wants to put on heavy VR goggles when they are tired from working 7hrs at a job just to do an online meeting. Nobody wants to do grocery shopping by putting heavy VR goggles when you can do that with a click of a button. The virtual world is not compelling unless its narrative driven or mechanics driver, basically, a video game. VR is great for an immersive video game, not headache inducing, motion sickness inducing, tiring meetings. I hope Facebook goes down in flames for all the privacy breaches, horrible algorithmic manipulation, incompetence, propaganda this horrible tech giant has served up to the world.

Also, how long until all the customization becomes microtransactions which is analogous to the worst video game practices around? This thing Meta is building is just trying to get the same microtransactions monetisation revenue that Fortnite and Call of Duty gets. They will use every psychological trick and pressure point to manipulate kids(like Fortnite, CoD, Genshin Impact) into buying worthless digital avatars just so they can get their billions in revenue. Its all an effort to commodify every aspect of our lives, not solving any problems rather compounding them to create little monetisation opportunities.

Disliked."

0,"I lost all respect for you after this video. Desperate last ditch pitch to sell big tech and Zuck's worthless merch. Stop selling trash. Sell Out!!! It feels like you're standing on an off ramp with a card board sign that says ""need rent to pay for VR"" and ""will work for meta"""

2,My 16yr old says he's buying in which I about hit the floor as he is so anti FB and all it stood for.  He was quick to point out the amount of investment and lead they have in the space along with the convenient truth of having the stock on sale right now.  I threw some chips at it.
0,"The downside is that for Meta, everyone needs to get the devices. When no one is getting these devices. People are sticking to their smartphones and not this VR/AR universe."
0,"Call me old-fashioned, but I'll take real reality over fake virtual reality, which holds no appeal to me. Moreover, Zuckerberg is a pinhead, drivel- brain, Deep State/Great Reset-worshipping, censorship-pushing fascist, so why would I want to enter any virtual reality that he creates?"
2,"Facebook, I mean Meta, wants to become the next Google."
1,"Amazing, thank you!"
2,"I think a big part of VR catching on is that VR has to offer experience that can't or wouldn't usually be achievable in real life. This applies mostly to video games but also to just about anything. The best VR games are either immersive ones that put you in an impossible situation, like a space walk, or you can talk with anybody from anywhere as if you were next to them. The same goes for work. I saw some comments suggesting that VR could be used for training in dangerous jobs, and I agree. What I DONT think VR will catch on with is normal everyday office work. Sure some huge companies can use it to collaborate with overseas partners, but for the vast majority of companies, just coming into an office building is much more convenient."
0,Why would anyone want to give an odious organisation that has shown zero comprehension of privacy or basic concepts in law their detailed biometric data. This entire concept is destined to fail because A it is being pushed by Meta and B there is no business case. There is nothing this does even half as well as more traditional means.

0,Put a Zuck sticker on something and you can be 100% sure I won‘t buy it
0,"AR/VR will definitely happen, but it won't come from Facebook/Meta.Also, this is not new tech; it's been in development with many working iterations since the mid-1990's. And BTW, the web-portion of the internet wasn't always about advertising and buying stuff...it used to be good. Lastly, Facebook is horribly designed, with an awful user interface, so it's no wonder Zuck rebranded...Facebook is dead. There's no business left there. Just bad code. VR is the future, but Zuck isnt. VR needs to be a truly-open standard, NOT controlled by a Microsoft or a Meta."

0,Get those politicians to use Metaverse for those useless meetings. So they don't travel around world burning taxpayers' money and spewing CO2.
0,"I think @meta made a big mistake. Meta put the cart before the horse. Steve jobs said it best, "" you have to start with customers experience and work your way back to the technology."" It's ok to have an idea, but the question is ""is this what customers wants?!"""
0,I can count on my middle finger how many people care about metaverse
0,Metaverse = a bad Sims VR simulation
2,I have a friend who is convinced that Facebook is gonna go bankrupt because of all the money they are putting into Metaverse and because their stock has fallen so much. He has no concept of how the economics of a company actually works. Meta still profits tens of billions each year and is still the number one social media platform in the world with 1/3rd of the world using their services each month. Meta is not going to go bankrupt over this. I'm in business college and he's a machinist that thinks he knows economics.

1,Thanks!
2,If they take a hit and  making headset more accessible meaning cheaper. They might get more users. Like what Sony did with PS3. That would pay out.

1,With 10 more years of quarantine vr will DEFINITELY be the future😂

0,Meta is an absolute waste of time and money.
2,"Marques, Now we see ads for just talking about things. So I was out with a friend and a Toyota Hilux rolled up. I just told my friend that this is the truck I want to get someday and we just headed back home. Once I was home, I opened my Insta and there it was! An ad for Toyota Hilux. So it's true right that our devices are constantly listening to us? That's scary af. Since then I switched to an iPhone but I don't really know how safe that is really."
0,"Yeah its cool how it works, but I really just don't see my self all day long with a headset.  Maybe with augmented reality I would."
0,seems mark must be desperate to be hosting live demos for you tubers....
2,"Apple is silently watching Meta from the sidelines. They'll swoop in at the right time, like they always do, and dominate whatever market sector this eventually becomes."
0,"I deleted Facebook, and strictly hang out in R."
0,Remember the headset has two tv screens inside. Not good for the eyes.
0,"Nobody likes FB and absolutely no one likes Zuckerberg.  Meta was destined to lose market value, but the decision to use Zuckerberg as the model to show off Meta probably cost FB half or more of the billions they've lost.  Maybe Musk could pull that off but most CEO's should avoid making themselves the story.  But, of all the CEO's that shouldn't have their face as the model for their products Zuckerberg is a uniquely poor choice.  Zuckerberg looks like Howdy Doody ... if Howdy Doody were a serial killer!"
2,"My first instinct is to tell you how stupid Meta is and that nobody would be stupid enough to buy into it. Over the years people went from playing games to try to beat others high score to playing games and thinking they are as good in real life as they are in the game. Then came search engines that hide what they don't want you to see. Every once in a while when a search engine got to that level, the people would ditch it because we knew they were tailoring/hiding results.

Then came the destroyer of everything. Social media, where fools and liars can pretend they are not. they always used to talk about parents letting the TV raise their kids. This is adaptive AI, fantasy and liar training software raising kids. I think they will buy into this crap. No, it won't  help with training more than an animation would. Somewhere out there is a video of a kid who was the best at Colin McRae Rally. They actually gave him a Subaru rally car, not 600hp but around low 300hp. That stupid donut never made it past 30 seconds he and bashed that car around like a bumper car. If anyone can find it, post teh link puhleeeeze.

Fake searches, fake people , fake abilities, fake information. You can't fake the majority of your life, put the VR goggles down and be competent in reality. I'd use Meta if I was a quadriplegic so that I could feel like I could participate as much as someone else. You can't even be a quadriplegic in Meta. You have no legs..."
2,Meta (Mark) is just trying to create something that’s actually theirs. Facebook? Not their idea. Instagram? Not their idea. VR? Not their idea BUT they have the opportunity to take it to the next level

2,Clutch shooter works tho so if u miss time u can still green when the score is like 12 or 14
2,"VR at most to me will be useful for gaming, work, and entertainment (when I am alone). Even gaming I prefer all my friends to play together physically in the same space than meeting up virtually. What about for living? Nah, I rather live in the real world than the virtual."
2,Wake me up when they can impant vr screens directly into my retina
0,"AR will win out. We feel disconnected enough looking at our phones all day, to fully immerse oneself in a virtual world seems unappealing. AR and wearables seem far more appealing and frankly, like a massive improvement on phones and personal computing devices as far as seamlessly integrating the real world and the web. Meta screwed up horribly thinking VR would win out and have widespread adoption in the next 5 years. Meanwhile, Apple is very quietly working on AR and selling plenty of phones, iPads, macs and software to get them there. RIP meta, Apple will win."
0,"Perhaps if FB didn't coddle extremist hate speech on their platform for the past decade, the vast majority of people might be interested in their attempt at burgeoning tech. Although it's becoming glaring evident that Zuckerberg wasn't the innovative maven of the initial FB team, it was the people he fucked over. Meta can't crash and burn fast enough."
1,"younger people feel differently, but i feel i would definitely give AR a try. pretty cool to have augmented reality. have things to assist me day to day, kind of like google glass but more advanced.

directions, looking up information. all great without having to pull out your phone and looking up and down. or watching TV on a long bus ride without having to look at your phone. or watching sports while going to places or room to room without missing the action"
2,"Scan yourself, warts and all? No. There is a reason why filters are popular on Tiktok.

0,One factor That’s important to me is that Facebook contributed the destruction of democracy for the sake of profits and I will never forgive them for that
0,If they just had a virtual reality headset .....just to watch movies priced around $500 then you could probably sell a couple of hundred million sets.... But Zuckerberg just lost $100 billion
0,"I think if it pertains to having to actually stay healthy like in ready player one, then no ha ha"
0,"To put it bluntly the Metaverse just... isn't... cool. And neither is Mark Zuckerberg. I think he should 100% stay behind the scenes on this one because his face doesn't sell. I agree that one of the biggest hurdles is the size of those goggles. As of right now, they just aren't socially acceptable. Putting big clunky tech on your head is embarrassing. The biggest market as of now are introverts that have the ability to lock themselves in their room and put on the headset in privacy. AR will never take off without smaller more unobtrusive tech."
2,Meta is good approach it just badly advertised

1,"Facebook was great and I want to support Zuckerberg, but he did contribute to manipulating the elections, so at the same time I don't think he deserves the support. I like the idea, I can't lie. It can become very popular if the price is right. the reason social media is so big is because it's free. The more people that can afford it, the more useful it can become. What would be better is virtual room technology environment, not just an individual headset, something you can use with your phone in VR with some light glasses. Bulky VR headsets are a difficult sell."
0,"Bro my eyes alre already f-ed, you all think I am going to be living in there and have business meetings?"
0,"Basically facebook aka meta wants more profit. Why don't they start selling toilet papers for dogs, cats and cows world wide instead? They could become a multi-gazillion dollar company overnight. That is what their board of directors would like!

I have gotten to where I can cheat an extra ""half layer"" as I refer to it by moving a hand across different voices at a pattern that, ideally, repeats out of sync with the other layers. I'd like to make a video demonstrating a few of them if I could just convince myself to practice a sequence well enough to seamlessly play some examples of all of these ideas.

2,"The crossrhythm sqrt(2)/2 (used by Nancarrow) is very close to 7/10:

Sqrt(2)/2 = .707....
7/10 = .700...

This means that if you do a 7:5 crossrhythm in (say) eighth-notes, then change the 5 voice to 16ths, then the 7 voice is playing at .700... of the speed of the 10 voice.

Then lengthen the 7 voice by approximately 1% more (=.007/.7) and you'll be playing a very close approximation of the sqrt(2)/2 polyrhythm. The 7 voice will go gradually out of phase (lagging behind) the 10 voice. In the exact version, the voices never again meet exactly because sqrt(2) is irrational, I.e. the exact ratio is a decimal that never ends and never repeats.

(But the .707 approximation might sync up again, depending on how you do the math, because in effect the 7 voice goes under a giant 99:100 bracket!)

Where does that rank?

This isn't trolling. It's Nancarrow's Study for Player Piano No. 33. Well, almost exactly."
2,The 5th to the 7th is a Maj. 3rd and the ratio of a tritone is 729/512.
2,"As an illiterate musician, this sounds like crazy talk to me."
2,"Adam, question if you find a moment to answer: Why is 4/4 so common in popular music nowadays in western music? I've been exploring folk styles of western europe and I find they often fall on something like 3/8 or 6/8? Maybe I'm misinformed on both accounts, this is just my perception on the matter, but can it be that high class music in the modern era decided to precisely distance itself from those patterns?"
1,Hell yes for the Brotherly reference. System is such a dope track and that whole One Sweet Life album is just fire the whole through....

2,Who else got confused af until you realized the people in the comments are typing the polytheism and not the timestamp when that happened lmao
1,"Great video. And great drumming; it's so nice hearing them played on a kit.

7:4 is my favourite. Though, I do use polyrhythms at quite slow tempos so I'm not even if it'd be considered ""polyrhythms"", rather than phasing. What IS the boundary between phasing and polyrhythms? Is it purely notational? Hmm"
2,Ooh I made a song with the 6:5:4:3:2 polyrhythm
2,"My favorite polyrhythm is 50:51, Tishchenko!"
2,I am a bit confused with some of the rythms. But for example the 6:7 feels like a 6:8 with accents on the 7s. Am I wrong or is this not a polyrhythm but a 2 polymeters running parallel? I might have misheard. Play help me out :D

2,3:2 is the only one I can reliably do
2,1:26 Thicc/heavy
2,3:5 is way cooler when you have 3 beats in the space of 5 (usually eighth notes) rather than the other way around.
2,"The thing that bums me out about a lot of use of polyrhythms is people try to make them as smooth and unobtrusive as possible. I really like when polyrhythms stick out like sore thumbs, like Charles Ives. 😅"
2,I guess 99:100 would be pretty difficult to deliver in the way that people wouldn't think it was some sort of a weird MIDI latency or another glitch :)

2,Can white performers be considered “hip-hop artists”?
1,Satisfying that 7:11 is when the 7 against 11 polyrhythm is placed in A Tier.
2,"Saying “against” is a bit misleading. Saying 3 with 4 is more accurate, also, poly rhythms are so limited as they are values stacked vertically. Western musicians don’t have much concept of linear expressions of values, which is the basis of Indian rhythm. Indian classical music is recognized as one of the most refined systems of rhythm, interestingly enough polyrhythms are understood but not used to generate the music. Overall point is that polyrhythms are overrated and overused, strangely enough, linear expressions of values are not explored in drum set land. As a western drummer, before learning Tabla, it’s like playing guitar without knowing anything about harmony or chords. Consider, playing value groups linear. 5+5+3+3 = 4/4 meter. It’s a linear expression of the vertical 5 with 3 polyrhythm. You can arrange 5 and 3 in infinite combinations linearly, but with the polyrhythm there is only 1 expression of 5 with 3."

1,"Shawn has such an amazing skill when it comes to working with time signatures. I am not a percussionist, unless you count piano (I consider it a string instrument but ig it technically could be both), but there's something so cool and special about the drums. It's the backbone of the rythem and the fact that thus mf is like ""oh yeah I can do that"" 
When my 10 years of music theory brain is like "".... HUH?!"" 

I think I'll start learning percussion because I feel like this is a skill that percussionist can more easily master."

1,"Are You Experienced

Thanks yet again for very interesting content - and for getting right to it, unlike so many who have to tell me everything that happened since whatever. 

I think it's funny how music imitates life experience. I mean, how everything in music is about getting aquainted with something - and then perhaps even being surprised.

When/as you become a musician, you become familiar with one thing at a time. And later, the things combine and start confusing you. Then you get used to it, maybe you even analyse it to find out what exactly is going on, which is like science, like using a microsope when you move a drum beat one 96th to make the rhythm more swaggery (is that a word?).

Later again, worlds start opening in front of you, different genres with different emphacies, different grammar and qualities. Like when reggae lets the bass play melodic counterpoint-like themes, and the guitar then mimmics the hi-hat, which again plays percussion while the bass drum poses as a snare etc. 

I listened to ""When We Danced"", one of the latest from ABBA. Just three chords. But not boring. Giant Steps is an appropriate opposite to this - on one parameter the number of chords and transpositions. But many other pieces of music ""opposes"" or mirrors it in as many other ways.

Music is a rich world of stories in many languages. That's all I'm saying. And I recoomend anyone to listen to Swedish folk, Irish and English ditto, Hungarian and Bulgarian song and Balkan rhytm and tonality, as well as music Gambia (Sona Jobarteh) and of course the Baka people, ""[...] an ethnic group inhabiting the southeastern rain forests of Cameroon, northern Republic of the Congo, northern Gabon, and southwestern Central African Republic."" (source Wikipedia)"
1,Thank you for this. Truly.

2,E2nd
2,1st
1,Nice Among Us is back. Was wondering what happened to the videos.
0,So it's Survivor but worse
2,Lol his strat is basically going to pee everytime
2,"Well the opportunist is the easiest role in the game. You should always win the game with it, its a win win situation. Youre both the 8th crewmate and the 3rd impostor. All you need to do is to announce that you’re the opportunist and the impostors won’t kill you. So you also wont get sussed out and win. Crew voting you wouldnt benefit them because you’re not the impostor."
2,LILYPICHU THE BEST AMONG US PLAYER?????
2,Objective: Survive
2,They should let one player be the Game Master and pick the roles for the other players before the game starts.
2,Thats Survivour role from Town of Salem
1,Im 23 halfway done with my mech engr degree and i cant help but absolutely fucking love toasts amongus content 🤣
2,What’s the day they play
0,"give up man, let this game die"
1,I never get tired of Chrono Trigger music. Truly one of the greatest sound tracks in gaming history.
0,Bruh this mod sucks
1,AMONG US KING IS BACK!!
2,Can someone explain the terrorist role ?
0,Sorry but why did we have to watch 10 mins of nothing for you to die 😂
2,You should try playing Town of Salem
2,Man said that’s meta gaming gtfo my guy 😂
2,i would never win opportunist KEKW
2,These mods just keep getting closer to Town Of Salem
2,"I think Opportunist Role will become more interesting and exciting to use in a proximity chat mod... Coz they can make deal with jester, impostors, anyone to live"
2,"Quick question: If you have this mod installed, can you still play normal among us with others? or do you have to uninstall the mod to play normally?"
1,"Toast and gang, thank you for this video, I have recently stumbled on all of you videos and they have brought slight moments of joy to my life in this trying time. Thank you soo much and I can't wait for more"
1,Love the music
2,"yo toast, why were you peeing twice in 2 consecutive games?? You doing ok?"
0,PLEASE lower the sound effects/music volume! Some parts of the video were borderline unwatchable with headphones.
2,terrorist = super jester ?
2,"I feel like the Opportunist role could be improved by making the opportunist choose a side within 3 rounds. The Opportunist would see the flow of things during the 3 rounds, choose a side to side with (impostors, crew, neutral special roles such as executioner), and help that side win while staying alive. Once we make him choose a side, we could tell him someone who is on that side (including dead), but not the people themselves. The other side wouldn't be able to tell though.

For example, if he chooses crewmate side, he'd know one person is crew for sure, though that person could be a dead person. The crew wouldn't know if he's lying since impostors could pretend to be the opportunist choosing the crew side.
If he chooses impostor, he'd know one impostor, and he'd basically be a lawyer for that impostor, and it'd be just bad luck if the impostor he knows is already dead. He'd still lose if he dies, so he would've to be careful.
If he chooses executioner, he'd know who to support, but he wouldn't know the target. However, the executioner is dead, he'd become the new executioner.
If he chose serial killer, he'd be basically lawyer again.
You'd be able to make creative goals/missions for the opportunist depending on which role they choose.

However, since there are way too many roles, it'd be simpler to make it like the following:
First, choose between Crew, Impostor, Neutral at the end of round 3.
If you choose crew, you know one crewmate for sure.
If you choose imposter, you know one imposter, and you are basically a lawyer that wants to live at the same time.
If you choose neutral, you are told a random neutral role's name, and you are given the ability to absorb that person's role and accomplishments. You could be given the ability to kill that person to take their power, or maybe you have to stick to them for a certain amount of time, both are good options. If there are no neutral roles left alive, you could lose, or be assigned a random role. When I say absorb the person's accomplishments, I mean that they'd get all the stacks the previous person had, such as dousing for arsonist, tasks for the terrorist and the like."
2,when was this stream
1,That was different it was cool to see the new roles in action
2,"Sanitizer is my favorite food, how about yours?"

0,"fwiw, drinking out of a big water jug like that is not a great idea since the germs end up back in it and it takes awhile to drink the whole thing.  Unless you are finishing it fairly quickly you can end up with a bunch of fun water to make you sick! :)"
0,"The most broken (and unfun) way to play opportunist is to just declare your role isnt it? 

This role is basically a 9 player game in a 10 man lobby - crew/neutrals/imposters wont feel that the role is a threat at all and could just ignore him."
2,Playing Opportunist is like playing Yuumi in League of Legends.
0,“Technically challenged” is the funniest way of saying they suck as downloading mods
0,Sheeeeeeeeesh
2,"does this mod pack allow player from different platforms to experience the mod pack or is it still only for pc but just easier for the players? Just wondering, thanks. :)"

2,So it’s surv from town of salem
2,"Opportunist is actually one of the easier roles, all you have to do is survive and it doesn't matter who wins. You can support or vote out anybody without worrying."
2,Isn’t Opportunist just Survivor?
1,The chrono  trigger music. Thank you Toast
2,Not technically challenged 😂😂😂
2,If you ever watch his streams you know he is telling the truth about his friends being technologically challenged
2,"Last time I was this early, I blew up the guy in first."

2,bro toast just said terrorist wins and its 9:11 rn 😭
2,"how much effort did you put into the first 30 seconds of the video, and how did you decide on good music throughout your video?"
1,The man himself is back❤❤❤❤❤
2,I’d feel like it’d be more balanced out if you added the executioner and made them their target every time
2,Technically challenged is crazy
1,I hear Chrono Trigger music and I like and comment!
2,opportunist is literally a backseat gamer
2,Technically challenged 😂
0,No one cares.
2,We need aMONgus Mondays
2,AMONG US
2,why did that guy keep saying he meta gaming how would saying a role be meta gaming
1,I love how Wendy always sounds like she kidding when she guesses what someone’s doing but she’s always dead on
2,"See, opportunist, or survivor, is a really interesting role not because of how it works, but how other factions can use it to their advantage.  An imposter or crew can claim opportunist in order to survive meetings/rounds, and then betray the faction opposite to theirs. And once the imposters start claiming opportunist, then people get skeptical of other people claiming the role, so the jester can claim opportunist to get voted out!"
2,Anyone else play with this mod? How does it look from the non-host side?
2,"The town of Host will be a reference to the Town of Salem, a turn-based precursor to this that is still popular enough on steam"
2,"Probably not the best place to ask this question but if u play apex legends. Whatd a fast way to level up battle pass, I've done all daily and weekly challenges and literally need 30 battle stars and there is 1 day remaining."
1,Always a great day when Toast uploads an AmongUs video
1,AMOOOONG UUUSSSSS :X
2,Honestly this is toasts only content I watch I try other stuff but he always seems like he doesn’t like doing whatever it is.
2,Upload?
1,"Toast, I really appreciate you man. You got me through the start of covid. You took a break so I decided to check out sykkuno. I just want to say you all make my day infinitely better(when i have time to watch ofc lol)."
2,"I mean i guess it would be boring but. That role xould potentionally just say "" hey im opportunist im gonna adk"" and win no ?"
2,Tbh this opportunist role is budget survivor
1,Gosh I love among us
2,"So it's basically a ""survivor"" from supersus in among us gaha"
2,what do all the other roles do??? I wish he could explain...
1,Hahahaha they underestimated lily hahahahahahahahahaha ahhh I love you guys so much 😂♥️
1,Toast and his default hiding place hahaha and still live after pissing and getting water lolol
2,AMOGUS
2,I don’t know how the other roles work. Opportunist is the only one he explained ( Vampire makes sense as a bite) and all the rest are alien. Anyone know how they work?
2,i missed toasts among us 😭
1,Feel like opportunist could be a fun role in proximity chat among us!
1,Classic Toast and his ways lol
2,"When I first played the mod, I thought Opportunist was the most boring role. Eventually, it became fun when I realized I didn't just need to be crewmate, and I could try to get the jester out or help the impostors win."
2,If only you could play stayin alive
2,"The ""technically challenged"" 💀"
1,"I'm glad this mod is getting a lot more attention because it's awesome, especially for people who want to play modded without needing a group of people all with the mod."
2,lily the first terrorist win! ...why does it sound so bad loll 🤣
2,Anyone know what day this was streamed on?
1,I love how Toast threw Lily out for absolutely no reason other than minor sus and the fact that he wants to trigger her even more😂😂😂😂😂

1,"I play town of host all the time now, it’s so much fun especially bc mobile people can play it"
1,"I am simple man. 
I see Toast Among Us, I click."
1,I think the opportunist is such an interesting role because you both want to not get sussed out but you also don’t wanna be seen as too innocent and killed. Toast did a great job of walking the line with his silence.
2,What is the downside to telling everyone you're the opportunist?
1,Toast is iconc😍😍💪👍

2,"Odd fact about Lego, it is digestible after a certain year due to Lego trying to be safer if accidentally swallowed, so if I swallowed a modern day mystery bag Lego figure, it won't come out the way it came in and probably would be like cheese wax on the way out. As a guy who likes Legos, I watched a how it's made and it says it's made of ABS after the mid to late 2000s which is digestible"
2,"For food theory fun, try playing around with salt of Amun, aka Ammonium Chloride. It's the 0% Sodium super salt used in super salty liquorice, but can be used on it's own for some spicy taste. US FDA doesn't like it, and EU FDA requires the candy to be marked ""adults only"", but I suspect the science against it may be exaggerated."
2,"This mildly reminds me of one of the brawndo/powerthirst video gag commercials. ""Use your sweaty body to fuel sweet rave parties!"""

2,"Reminds me of the time when I worked at walmart, where a particular College Football team with a blue and orange color palette was located. I had a dozen small cupcakes with the team's colors all over them. At the other end, I was literally producing Minecraft's cyan dye for a few days. (didn't even do it for a challenge; I just wanted some cupcakes)"

1,There is just a lot of 💖💗💝Sir Tom Jones. Just listen...
1,such an incredible voice . from malaysia
1,Oh Tom you are so amazing
0,"1. The coaches singing is Not ""auditions""....
2. It's called the The Voice - not the The Groups.
3. David Adeogun was a true singer. Some of the others were but if you are in a group you shouldn't be on this show - go to something like BGT/AGT/etc. Clare was likewise a true singer with her voice as her musical instrument. Similar for Rachel and for control and tone might have been the best. But will this show let someone win who is over 40 ?
4. Good judge/coach doesn't look at the others to see what they think are going to do - they know talent when they hear it and hit their button. Be a leader, not a follower.
5. The rap artist was more like a karaoke joke.... I've heard better from people passing on the sidewalk.
Is it just me, or is the The Voice losing its high standards?"
1,"It’s such a privilege to listen to these gifted artists, thank you"

0,"the UK Voice really nose-dived sharply when it switched from BBC to ITV. i watch a lot of The Voice from the rest of the world and frankly, the UK version is embarrassing in comparison. even the so-called ""judges"" are z-listers. cringeworthy and awful. they seriously need to spend less time on the judges and more time researching better contestants. just my 2 cents."

Other than the Marvel movies (which I'm not eager to watch because of their recent trajectory), they all look low budget.  

The film industry is dying."

2,Married 9xs...ok now I  blame the partners unless they had no idea that she had that many partners. I personally would never consider a person as a potential mate married that many times.  Wow.🤣🙄
0,Will never get why after one bad marriage people do it again.
0,"""It doesn't matter if she's a horrible person, as long as she's hot"" -men"
2,I know I shouldn't but I giggled like a girlie throughout this video. What a woman! Shame about the murder part! 😆
1,So powerful to be able to laugh in the face of darkness. Its also a very strong 😅Protector  and Directer for the heart. The Mirth is the necessary ingredient that assists the path to understanding and healing. That’s what I get here anyway . 😊
2,I a few years ago had the pleasure of working with a female nurse who was about 55. She had been married 13 times. She kept photoalbum of each marriage ceremony like a serial killer keeps souvenirs.
0,Could you lighten up on the corny theories? The silliness is detracting from  your fact-based analysis of these incidents.
2,"11/5/22 Failed Divorce, I can’t even keep up with # of times Married. None really lasting a year! She really doesn’t like being alone, she maybe Black Widow? Idk how never charged with murder on ? Second Husband shot x2"
2,She tricked NINE men into a whole marriage...and I can't even get a text back. Wow🤯
2,"Boy she gets em fast and then loses them real fast too!! I think all told majority of her ""marriages"" lasted a whopping year."
0,"I like money (who doesn't) but would I marry for money (hell no), I like my freedom more.   I tried marriage once, and never again, boyfriends sure, but I'm not the marrying type.   Nine times...I would have killed myself before number three....lol"
2,dr. grande - knowing your analytical skills...this analysis would be even better with a diagram and timeline of all the husbands weddings gs divorces deaths and murders :) would be a great add on at the end 😀
2,"I really am intrigued by Jill as a therapist. Her new therapy ""technique"" and best selling book "" Dont forgive and forget, just murder them"" would be a best seller. And imagine, how could anyone possibly be prosecuted? You got your insanity diagnosis from Dr. Jill ,  and Dr Jill's  treatment plan to murder,  and bam! What jury would convict you?"
0,I have seen a couple of documentaries on her. Pure evil.
2,I'm 6 minutes in and all these husbands weddings and divorces are making me confused...how on earth did u keep all of this straight?
1,"Dr Grande, your capacity to review these disturbing and confusing events with clarity and insight is astounding.  Take excellent care of yourself because we need these thoughtful analyses you provide"
2,Dr Grande woukd you consider sharing your perspective on MACKENZIE PHILLIPS and her fascinating and tragic story?
2,Could you analyse sally schofield please?
2,this is showing what part of the body many men use when ending up 6 feet under . So sad that good look got over good character.  I myself as a good looking ( was exactly seen this ) most men didn't care about who I am as a person as long as I look good. I prefer to marry man who's face bun out but heart is gold. Thanks!  Most handsome men who I meet are like this woman - very narcissistic. Good look will fade but good character ain't.
0,"Wow she was such an ugly manly woman, it's amazing that many men had such low standards."
1,"I've just seen a video where Dr Grande's legs are visible. This is obviously rare. I'm no expert, but I think his legs are probably high in agreeableness."
0,"She was a career criminal. Using and lying to men to get what she wanted, and finally, murdered one who wouldn't stand down. I hope she rots in prison"
1,That last joke was hilarious oh man keep up the good work may God bless you and your family
2,So...she's single?! Get my top hat and cane!
2,Nothing puts the arrow on your back unlike the ex spouse who threatens to give you hell when your marriage goes wrong.
2,"It would be very interesting to interview some of the many husbands.  Those still alive, I mean."
1,"You are so funny sometimes , lol"
2,"That was fun, but probably not an analysis. I certainly miss some kind of explanation why does anyone behave the way she did. It's liking money and weddings really enough?"
2,"At some point you shouldn't be allowed to marry anymore, possibly after the third. Marriage isn't something for you."
2,"Wow, fake Dr Grande is really all over this comment board. Go away fool nobody's ""telegramming"" you!!  
As for the story, really interested  in what made this woman so attractive. She doesn't appear that attractive but it could be she just isn't that photogenic. Some people shine in person, in photos or on film. Example, I saw Jane Fonda once at a small political rally and I thought this woman talks like an idiot, but she really is quite beautiful whereas on film I always thought she looked like Henry Fonda in drag. So was this lady much more attractive in person? Did she have a fascinating personality? Was she a ""love bomber""? Sexthalete? Really wished for a deeper dive without diagnosing her of course."
2,I’m just wondering how many of the 9 husbands had guide dogs? Asking for a friend
1,Love you Dr Grande
1,"I do..sort off hahaha
Great analysis, thank you dr.Grande"
1,I enjoy listening to you tell me bedtime stories.
2,"Wow, what a story. Does anyone else worry about ending up on his channel sometimes?"
2,She nearly had nine lives .
2,"Whenever I see crime taking place in my neighborhood:

 ""And what exactly COULD be happening in a situation like this?"""
1,Ty doc. I remember forensic files covering this case. U go into much more detail. Sooooo awesome. (Occasionally I have to rewatch certain vids over and over because of my disability related short-term memory loss.) U make it so that I only have to do that from time to time on ur vids. U rock doc
0,Why keep marrying? It seems she wasn't good at it
2,This story proves that there is a sucker born every minute.
1,"Great video, Dr. Grande! 
Loved the ""As she grew older, her birth date also advanced in years."" 😅
Hope you have a great weekend, you deserve it! ♡♡"
2,"Hi doctor grande, could you do a video on porn addiction and also a video on why some people find their partner watching porn as a form of cheating? I'd like to understand porn addiction more and I'd also like my fiance to understand the possibility of why some people feel that way about it being a form of cheating. I love your videos, I watch them every day and I really value your opinions on every single video. It would mean so much to me. Thank you 🖤"
1,"Wow, Jill Coit really doesn't believe in the ""until death do us part"" part. Interesting.  Thank you for the analysis, Dr. Grande."
2,As a murderer I'd say she had definitely had cold feet. Buried somewhere.
1,“Sounds like Jill was trying something new” I had to replay that about four times I laugh so much
2,"This woman's 'script' for 'self-fulfilling life progress' was quite suspense filled ;D It had my full attention after husband number eight - and, ""Jill wasn't married to anybody"" - finally, ""moving to the timeline of the crime"" What a character this woman was, unbelievably unstable but convincing otherwise :)"
2,"Dr. Grande - could you discuss the death of James Rayl?  His behavior before and during the incident seems very strange, and I wonder if he was going through a mental health crisis.  Please give us your opinion about what happened, and about the crusade by Rayl’s sister to get the case reopened.  Thank you!"
2,Please cover Bob Crane case
2,Thinking about marriage gentlemen? 🤔
2,"i dont know how the hell she met all these men, she must have been totally extroverted and a total party animal, how did she approach these men? did she ask them out? or did she wait until they asked her out?"
2,I guess her high-rise didn't have a thirteenth floor.
2,Candice DeLong interviewed her in prison for the series Facing Evil. Her prison interviews and analysis are really interesting.
2,"why is it that everyone starts off as being single, yet many find themselves being unable to handle being single for even a second?  Although I find that this is the case with women most of the time, I do acknowledge that some men can't handle being single either."
1,"Thanks for your witty analysis of Jill Coit marital adventures and occasional dabblings in homicide. Clearly, she believed that variety was the spice of married life and she obviously had a short attention span. Hopefully, her wedding dresses were wash and wear and she multiplied the wedding cake recipe in order to freeze a number of them to thaw them out when needed."
2,I'm just a dirty white boy.!!!!
1,"Dr Grande, You've don't it again, Another crack-up me up video 😂😂😂"
0,I had first heard about this fool on Forensic Files
1,"Lmao that joke at the end about giving the patient a different routine , ahhh dr grande gotta love ya. It’s sad that people will look past shortcomings due to someone’s looks. “It’s what’s on the inside that matters” yeah , right. Love these true crime analysis dr grande. Thanks for everything you put into these videos."

2,"""The client declined the opportunity to become part of a murder conspiracy.""  😆  Client had to have walked away thinking 'You know things aren't that bad actually.'"
2,Is she beating Liz Taylor in thw marriage stakes ?? 😁
2,"The million dollar question is, how can she find 9 husbands and I can't even find 1 😔"
2,🤡? Are men THAT easily conned by a hottie? C'mon guys! Find ur self respect & learn how to ZIP IT UP!!
0,I do not think she was very attractive at all! Must be her shining personality ? She must clearly have had “ something” that attracted men like flies to a dead body 😳
1,"That's a lot of husbands! Excellent analysis, Dr. Grande! ❤️"
2,Please analyze the Kyrie Irving situation and his overall history!
1,Love the quiet sarcasm :)
2,"She used to sing 'Never Enough' from the Greatest Showman at every of her own weddings, I was told. 😂😉🙋"
2,So basically she never had a boyfriend just husbands
2,"Dr. Grande, would you please look into the Netflix’s movie the Good Nurse? It is about the serial killer; Charles Cullen and his coworker/friend Amy Loughren. Thank you! 😊"
2,Omg Haitian Divorce! I need some Steely Dan jokes.
1,Dr. Grande! 👏👏👏👏👏 Always such an extraordinary background and case analysis! Tysvm for all of your dedicated work! BRAVO! 👏👏👏👏👏
2,Did she qualify for the guiness book of world records?? (most no of. Marriages + a murder as bonus feature)
2,Just needed 10 husband's
2,"Jill is perfect for Halloween... Dr. Grande seems like she's got Daddy issues for sure, right ? wow crazy be..awchh! BTW  Dr.G can we do King Charles, what's up his kilt seems text book narc., 2 me?"
2,I feel like I need a diagram for this case
1,"Dr. Grande as a faithful listener from Baton Rouge, LA - THANK YOU for your correct pronunciation of our cities, towns, villages and Bayous here in  Louzzianna. It is truly RARE and first rate and shows your scholarly respect for the vast and varied regions of the USA... Lafitte is most likely named after the famous Pirate, Jean Lafitte and Lafayette - (we do not pronounce it in a ""French way"" we pronounce it exactly as you did!) many states have a town by that name. Thanks for a great one for the weekend kickoff!"
2,Jill traded husbands like musical chairs. I wonder if Psycho Killer was her favorite song!
0,"10:30 Jill didn't misjudge how loyal folks around here would be to her. What she misjudged, was how loyal folks around here were to Gerry Boggs, who ""never met a stranger"" as the saying goes. He not only had no enemies, nobody ever had a bad word to say about him, period. I wish Jill a long life rotting in prison, followed by an eternity rotting in Hell."
2,I'm fairly certain I've gotten a murderous Therapist's as a kid post-parents divorce or perhaps just convinced a few they didn't want to work with child-cliente after graduation after all.
1,"Thanks for covering this one. I knew Gerry Boggs, and unfortunately Jill Coit. I was loading chairlifts at the time, broke ""A Current Affairs"" camera, they wouldn't leave my co-worker alone because she ""must know something"" because she worked for Seth, and lived, at the Bed & Breakfast. ACA's camera had an unfortunate ""skiing accident""."
2,"She sure was a master
Of manipulation."

1,I love to take chartered fishing in LaFitte.  Great Redfish!   There’s a giant sculpture of a mosquito with glowing red eyes on the side of the highway to the boat dock.
0,"I don’t see it. I thought of, “‘How does she get all those guys to propose? She’s not that beautiful.’ Bite me, paper boy,” from Runaway Bride. 🫣"
2,"Men seemed to hover around Jill like bees to honey.  She knew how to use her 'assets' and knew what men wanted.   She was more than willing to oblige. Jill was (is) a con artist willing to do anything to make her mark.  She even used her own son to help her murder.  Hiding underneath that beautiful exterior was a sociopathic narcissist.  Nothing hidden here,  everything out in the open . So if you are looking for that someone, BEWARE.  There are an unlimited number of women AND men ready to give you the ride of your life."
0,She's not that good looking.
1,"Good morning Dr Grande . This woman is a prime example of past  behavior predicts future behavior . Thank you Dr Grande,  Brilliant analysis.sad outcome informative topic ."

2,Swag
2,"Rest in Peace Gerald.💔💔🙏🙏🕊️🕊️ I believe Jill did it , too."
2,"Could it be, that her relationship pattern with the hims' in her life, began during adolescence. When her man/convenience store relationship ran out of her favorite treats, ditch the loser, and go candy shopping at the nearest bar. Plenty of drinking revelers to choose from."
2,"With that many marriages, in a short period of time, how does one remember names, and in the correct order??🤔🤔🤔"
1,"Hi, Dr. Grande!🙋🍀🪴🌵🪴🌵 How goes it? I had a book about her years ago. I love when you Analyze Cases I've had books about! Thank You!"
2,"She also married a couple of popes 30 or 40 other husbands 50 or 60 other elopes is there elope's elopements And 2 or 300 weekend flames,"

2,Tip toeing in.  No NJ jokes? 😬
0,WTH?!?🤷🏻‍♀️ Something is wrong here….this gal “married” more men than I dated during the 19 years I was single! How does that even happen???
1,"This story deserves your  humorous ending. Hope she will see the video. Who is laughing now, Jill?"
0,"I  don't think she got her husband because of her looks after a certain age.  Yeah, she was really good looking when young but grew into a plain and unattractive woman after 40.  It had to be something else.  My bet, being a Christian, is that it was something spiritual, as in evil spirits.  Lots of times married men fall for an unattractive woman which puzzles folks, but many times it's a spirit that does it.  In her later years she was fugly as hell."
2,"Gerald Boggs was just a good, hardworking guy @ his family owned business. Such a shame he encountered this female viper!"
2,"If she had marriages that were not legal, why would she have to get divorced from those legal marriages? She'll probably get married while in jail. What do you think?"
1,"omg I'm laughing so hard, "" a failed divorce""."
2,"Dr. Grande, are you familiar with the case of the Harvard student who killed her roommate and committed suicide? I believe her name was Sinedu Tadese. It would be interesting if you could analyze that case. 🙏"
2,Love and marriage go together like a gun and cartridge.
2,"She probably had a punch card ( 10th Wedding free) and was 1 away from a free wedding ceremony , just speculating 😂"
2,"Ok i can’t get 1 husband, girlfriend here gets unlimited refills."
2,Now that really is a bridezilla.
0,I'll never understand how a person can think it's a good idea to marry someone that's been married and divorced more than three times. Even three is pushing it.
2,When are you going to talk about the Pelosi episode? It seems like a great opportunity for your type of advanced humor.
0,"Wacko & evil woman, between the murder, & 9️⃣husbands. Too bad people depend on looks vs substance. Great jokes again. Thanks Dr G😊💜💜"
2,I'm ghosted after two messages on Tinder and this lady was married 9x AND she's a killer? wtf...
1,I always wonder if u ever laugh at your own jokes ;) Mayb u should do a blooper real hehe. Your awesome man!
1,"“You can rent our facility for three weddings, the forth one is free.”🤣😅

Thank you for the analysis and the humor! I hope you have a lovely weekend, Dr. Grande.❤"
1,"Hi Dr Grande I think she just liked wedding cake just my opinion, thanks for you're channel best wishes from the UK."
2,"The one constant in Jill's life was her quest for money.  It's interesting to note how many investment and life counseling services advise that same objective.  The shallowness of her goal was consistent with someone who had poor academic skills and little interest in obtaining a non-academic skill.  Being attractive is a huge advantage when dealing with the blind and shallow but it can be a caution for many people.  Beauty or handsomeness in general adds 20 points to IQ, 1 million to life earnings, and a multiplier to relationships in modern life.  Of course, if you are fortunate enough to know that true beauty shows itself in less publicly appealing ways, you might dispute this.  Pretty?  It seems Jill was a killer."
2,Google search would take care of this person in 2022 I think.
1,Love the sarcasm !
1,It's quite amazing how that woman can go from attractive to non attractive back to attractive and back to non attractive at random.
1,"Thanks Dr. Grande, this one was extra funny.😎"
2,I'm only 5 minutes into the video & already lost count on her marriages!! 🤪
1,"Hi Dr Grande, I hope you’re having a great start to your weekend.
Last night, I was searching for something to watch and I came across an older video of yours “Are there advantages to being mentally ill?” 
OMG! I was blown away! What a powerful and personal message!
I was humbly reminded why I love ❤️ this channel so much!
(Edited cause I messed up cause that’s what I do)."
0,What an odd and terrible person. I am wondering how her sons turned out.
1,"Good afternoon, Dr. Grande. 😃 You never cease to amaze me with your humor & sarcastic kindness (for such a bad woman) IE: 2:12-2:18..I, too, am kind/nice to undeserving people. Have a wonderful weekend! 🌵"
1,Here before the comments reach 100. Cool 😎
2,She moves up the professional chain with each marriage.
1,Hello Dr. Grande ! Just wanted to say 'THANK YOU' for providing us with these awesome videos ! Your insights into criminal behaviour and your analyses are priceless ! And I am learning a lot from them !
2,Look into the Johnathan reynoso and Abrey Moran murders in Coachella CA
2,"Doctor Grande! Here is a story that would be HUGE for your channel: The ""Doctor"" Linda Hazzard and her husband's story of ""Starvation Heights"" fame. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about those crimes. The body switching at the mortuary, the pit in the backyard, the fact that some victims were Ivar Haglund's mom (I think) and two British aristocratic women. A sensational and terrible story of fraud, financial crime and murders. It would be interesting for you to analyze Linda and her husband. They were actually going to make a movie about this, starring Reese Witherspoon but I think it got shelved."
2,"Oof, this dog can get 9 husbands without appreciating them and I can't even get a text back"
0,"I am not too bothered if I find a suitable parter or not, 
since the majority of men are rubbish liars.

I could not handle that many men 
as 9 nine monkeys in my bed ! 
Did the house fall on me ?

It sounds as if I am playing with hell fires - IF -
I only marry for money and sex .
It is the most horrible thing anyone can do . 
Adultery is as murder and
adulterous is ugliness. 

I like a handy man to :
fix my home , culture,  curvy body 
learn new languages for fun travel INDOORS  
do unusual things , definitely practice fun boxing 
and wild animal hunting, new ways to make electricity,  new community police , downplay the tradition of calling man a Sir and make new episodes of Star Wars / Trek,  teach my bunnies to play drums 🥁."

2,"Marrying a beautiful lady, a belle, will always come with a price. All the good and all the evil in one person. She loves but by her own terms. She loves your perseverance to make money but likes to spend it more. She is altruistic in one point but selfish on hundreds else. She loves giving birth to your children but have no time to raise them. She loves to see you comfort but wants you to make relentless effort to fulfill her needs. She make many stupidities but she expect you to always forgive her. These are few. If you have more please write it down 😃."

I would love to know what you see with the girlfriend Brockhill.
The little toddler was so cute and adorable and her family adored her but, she was kept from them - just like the girlfriend isolated the mother.  The mother was beautiful but, low IQ and easily led.
A tragic story"

There are so many more shark sightings per year than shark attacks. Most people are unharmed by sharks when they encounter them. There are usually less than 500 shark attacks globally per year. If you still think that's a lot, think about this. There is so much ocean out there, and nearly 8 billion people. In comparison that is a tiny number."

2,"My lucky story: when I was 8 years old I got in the car with my grandma moving away from our home. My dad was driving the U-Haul moving truck, my mom was driving my dad's sports Jaguar Car and my grandma was driving my mom's Jeep, I had a choice to go with my mom or my grandma, I went with my grandma against her saying she wasn't a good driver I assumed she was joking, when we got to a red light she forgot to pay attention and almost ran into the sports jaguar my mom was driving right Infront of her so instead she swerved to the side which lead the me, my grandma and my sister in the Jeep teeter-tottering on the edge of a wall that turned into a ditch right next to a building, we were about to cross a bridge as the ground suddenly drops but we were teetering on the bridge side, Thankfully me, my grandma and my sister all got out of the Jeep unharmed but as soon as we all got out the Jeep fell crashing into the ditch against the building below, there was 0 injuries but there was damage to the building and the Jeep was totaled. I am now 24 years old and I still flinch at the sign of bridges or sudden drops in the ground."

2,"When I was 10-11 I was in the front seat with my father. (I was like, 5’3 maybe 5’6, not sure. It’s genetic in my family to be really tall at a young age.) Someone went flying through a bypass coming towards us at 90 mph. I tried to tell dad to look out but he was too worried about what was going on in the texting world than what was going on in front of him. I got so worried and quickly put child lock on the seatbelt and held onto the seat with one hand, and a few moments before the truck had hit us, because dad didn’t have child lock on his seatbelt, I put my arm in front of his chest. I was so scared. I knew what was about to happen. I couldn’t swerve the truck to a different lane because someone else was in that lane and we would get into a wreck. Our car caught on fire and ambulances came immediately. Luckily the air bags deployed. I knew sometimes they didn’t work at the time, so I was PRAYING. we all luckily made it out alive, but this is why you don’t text and drive, or even look at your phone while driving. This type of wreck could have been fatal if we weren’t lucky. The doctor told us, because of the way the car hit us, and how fast it was going, there was only a 2%. chance of us being alive after the accident. Be careful out there."

0,Thats toxic
2,Area 51 by this time is most likely a decoy. If ever there was alien technology and/or alien bodies there surely they have been moved somewhere else a long time ago since everyone knows where Area 51 is and suspects those things to be there.
2,i love how angry some people get about the color of something.
2,why not show any images
2,"i remember watching a documentary a few years ago about the ""Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird"" that was built in area 51. they said how they knew russia and other countries flew over and take photos of the site to see what they were working on. these guys were OG trolls and used to put black painted modular parts outside and make them look like freaky airplanes to mess with other countires. i think you can still find images of the shapes online. some are hilarious and even look like modern planes, but others you will just roll around laugthing at."
2,What are you talking about on RAF Feltwell? I lived at RAF Feltwell from 1971 through 1974 while stationed at RAF Mildenhall. I had no idea there was anything interesting there and I have walked most all of the base. The only interesting thing I saw there was a friendly hedgehog that tunneled into an abandoned munitions bunker.
1,You have a really good speaking voice but man are pasty.
2,The thing that i often hear form this video is area 51. It is often discussed in movies and also in animation. 😁

0,Where are the photos? I just stumbled on this channel and it seemed interesting until you just spent 14 min bamboozling me. Definitely not returning for more.
0,"No actual pictures? I wanna see what you are talking about my dude. 

Also what is a Kray-ken?"
0,The photos can't be shown. Case closed.

2,"Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: 'after this, therefore because of this) is an informal fallacy that states: ""Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X."" It is often shortened simply to post hoc fallacy. A logical fallacy of the questionable cause variety, it is subtly different from the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc ('with this, therefore because of this), in which two events occur simultaneously or the chronological ordering is insignificant or unknown. Post hoc is a logical fallacy in which one event seems to be the cause of a later event because it occurred earlier.
Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because correlation sometimes appears to suggest causality. The fallacy lies in a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors potentially responsible for the result that might rule out the connection. A simple example is ""the rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise. It's this kind of thinking that causes things like human sacrifice."
0,SHOW.... PICTURES.... >:(
0,I'm really surprised that you're not showing the photos you're talking about?
2,"how does one tell stories from ""time immemorial""? Seems like a bit of an oxymoron if you ask me"
0,Are we supposed to google the images while you talk about them?
2,"11:50 well the explanation is quite simple actually. for some reason the part of the lake where red algee is growing in such ammount, the water is warmer, while where we can see green algee more prominent, the water is colder. Red algee prefers warmer water. For example Red Sea isn't that red like a lake but it does have a higher concentration of red algee due to the fact that the Red Sea is warmer than the Black Sea for example. We learned about these in elementary school, as I recall, so it's not a big mistery either."

I want that 15 minutes back."
0,"A downvote from me. If you cannot show the photo's DO NOT make a video about it, really annoying.
This is the 1st vid from Simon that I have downvoted, but if he keeps this up, it won't be the last."
2,If- you believe the people who claim to have worked at what the public refers to as Area51 the site we know of is just one of many. It is the main facility which has numerous satellite installations in the area not viewable from the air. There is apparently an entire underground network of tunnels that connects them all. If you believe what they say........

0,pics or it didn't happen
0,Hmmm... there is condescending tone toward anything 'Alien' related. Although I agree that most mysterious phenomena is somewhat explainable with modern science. There is a huge shift in how seriously the phenomena is taken now! This channel is too good to be a laughing stock at some point in the future. This continual beratement of anything even remotely associated with 'Aliens' will not bode well!

I subscribed after the very first video and I must have watched about 20 videos and then you suddenly stopped coming up in my stream and because of interconnected medical issues which leaves me with little short-term memory I completely forgot your name! I have now written it down on a list that I keep posted on the bulletin board so I don't have to wait for you to show up in my feed. I am so excited I found you again!
1,Always like your reviews. Keep it up!
0,"The key chain charger although crappy is the only one with a redeeming quality.  Sure it may only get you 20 percent of power, but that is just enough to call for help or find huir way if you ever are in a situation where yiu phone dies and it needs a charge.  Since it’s a key chain it will always be on you meaning you never need to plan to pack it or bring it with you.  Power banks are big and often don’t have them on your unless you plan for them"
2,That's a textured wall... Of course that shelf isn't going to stick on there for very long.
2,"The 'power pod' seems to me to be an emergency charger.. Especially as its advertised for attaching to s Keychain. When you're out and your battery dies and in an emergency situation. Though these days 2021 you can get 6, 0000-7,000mah chargers that are just as small and attach to Keychains, energizer do one that looks like a battery. Product seems like it was made in 2001—2002 where your Nokia only had 600-700mah yet would last for what seemed like 3months...even playing snake 24\7 😂😂"

2,"I own the draft top. I really like it, but it's admittedly it's gimmicky. What it's really supposed to do is let you get a good smell of your craft beer to improve the taste.

2,"I have the tax shaver and it does it's job. It's not a great razor but I've had worse. It compares to my more expensive razors but only barely. It pulls if the hair is even a bit tong. If you used it every morning it would be okay. But if you missed a day, you'd rather use an actual razor I think."
2,Just one minute in and it's obviously just another 💩 video
2,"I WAS ABOUT TO RECOMMEND THT OTHER RAZOR YOU SHOWED .. THE GREEN ONE!
As for the shower shelf, As with ALL stick on shower products have to put water UNDERNEATH the suction
then press firmly and wait, My other bath adhesives work great, The suction cups or bubbles or pockets are designed
so when pressed it holds firm by the air-pockets formed in the water, Most gimmicks do not mention everything so make sure to check!

As for the can...I would think that you are expected to pull the can top upwards before you push in the can cap
And as for the sound amp, I know I sound like i'm defending these products but i'm not, I'm just offering alternative ideas.

For ear piece, Hope they had a reason for giving you ONE thing. Anyways, EVERY product like this I got, no matter the price, sound like this, It is because it is not concerned about close up sounds or closeup wind hitting your ears, It CUTS through the noise and is the OPPOSITE of a noise canceler which cancels out waves, The amp ... AMPS up the waves, so although muffled and crackly, it's so you can HEAR farther and you can just enough to make out a LITTLE bit of what you wouldn't normally hear, Quality although closely the same does matter due to better tech, The biggest issue with these reviews is no instructions that are well made, Cheap materials, AND consumers failing to get it right for use or understand the product. - To get a better review, try and look for alternative ways of using the product that may not seem obvious. Heck even a Flint is seen as a bust due to this, People assume it doesn't work because of the black protective coating but neglect to scrape OFF the black before use!"
0,I was conned by alien tape....what a joke.....does not work.  Wish I’d watched this before buying.
0,"Speaking of terrible junk, that time wasting screen between products that has the count down on it and dudes freakin face is the worst.  After 3 times I couldn't stand to watch anymore."
0,I used a product called the scratch solution-for removing scratches on your car. 100% useless
2,Must be stuck to flat surface no texture
1,Where’d you get your sunglasses? I’m a fan of round frames. Yours look pretty darn sweet!
2,"This morning my husband told me that a mirror I had put up with alien tape had fallen and smashed, so it's funny for me to see it on a video like this (considering I never watch them)"
0,"Under water with sunglasses on, what a clown!"
2,You should have buried that 'smart cup' then you'll really be able to see if it decomposes
0,"It's the scent, not the smell. Smell is a verb. Jesus..."
2,He’s still trying to get that tray to swivel btw
1,I appreciate what you are doing à giving us the red flag on shitty products that are advertise. Notice all the unbelievable waste on the wrapping as well?
2,For some reason i want a next gen headache maker now.. Not sure what i would use it for but as long as it looks shiny i guess.. Maybe a tactical one for.. um.. home defence! :P
0,"After seeing these products, my question is: other than YouTube product reviewers, who the hell buys this crap?"

1,"What kinda sunglasses are those?
 I’d love to get a pair."
0,Appeal to the laziness of Human beings and you can sell them anything.
0,I got that can opener a few months ago another item in the junk utensil drawer
2,"The sink side dish thjngy is based on the same method  used to clean surgical equipment and delicate items, like thin glassware"
1,I love the suit in the kitchen.
2,Idk I’d personally put the battery charger above the swivel car thing. At least the charger is out of the way ish and sorta does it’s job. The swivel would just take you out in a car crash.
2,After I supposedly passed the Memory Expert coarse my neighbor wanted to give me a couple of dollars for it. I couldn’t remember where I put it.
2,"Honestly I don’t see the point of alien tape when command strips exist, because they can usually hold things quite well and be removed damage free."
2,"In my opinion,  the only ""Tach"" product worth buying is the flashlight.   Although the push button switch does not really last long on that."
0,"There are actually 10 or more different types of Can lid, and they can all be opened the same way and much easier with a traditional can opener... what a joke product lol."
1,7:14 When I was younger (90’s) there was a product called Chill Out. Best stuff ever. Spayed it on and it cooled you right down. Even took the pain out of sunburns. Had a light lemony scent. It was awesome so of course it doesn’t seem to exist anymore.
2,Why do you have shampoo...

2,Rob Halford reviews as seen on tv products
0,"Yeah, that can opener strikes me as a product in search of a problem to solve...and just creating new ones."
1,For the cup it would make an Amazing bug trap as they would be attracted to the smell and drown in the water
0,"Well, the swivel try is still garbage! But if you want it to swivel, just loosen the two black screws; one on the top and one on the bottom. Turn it into a right angle. Then it spins within the cup holder.  Anyway, it still looks like garbage though."
2,"The massive chard hopefully polish because pancreas unfortunatly sprout barring a wistful star. bashful, handsomely pyjama"
2,"I have a tactical toilet plunger, a tactical spatula and tactical floor mats in my truck and I can say in all truthfulness that they are vastly superior to their civilian counterparts. Next I plan on adding some tactical petunias to my garden."

2,"You should try reading the instructions.  The Draft Top is great, but you need to open the can first and then take a sip before using it.  Pretty sure it says that right on the package.  It also doesn't require a lot of pressure to work.  Just enough to flex the plastic of the 
handle a bit."

2,Honestly try to find a small keychain charger that would do better. It’s not supposed to do anything but get you out of a jam. It’s the best you can do with something that doesn’t bog your keys down
1,Thank you for spending the money so we don't have to.
0,"As soon as you see Bell + Howell, run away. They advertised a 10 Megapixel camera in the back of some weird conservative magazine a lady in a giant fur coat brought into my store. She was quite proud she had a much better camera than us rubes. I popped her bubble hard. This was in 2003, when I’m not sure a single consumer 10 megapixel camera even existed. What it actually was, was a 3 megapixel camera they upscaled. Straight up grifters top to bottom."
2,"I have question, 
question: Are you gay?
I'm not a homophobe, I'm just curious."
1,Thanks for warning us not to buy trash
2,What's the point of cutting off the top of the beer can?
2,Why are you opening beer cans with a can opener in the first place? Lol
0,"Dude,  get rid of your interludes, hands down.  And you couldn't have picked a stupider sound clip to use in it.  Your reviews are good,  but the only reason I saw or rather, listened to the entire video,  is because the phone was out of my reach.  Every time the next item came up, I got more irritated by that stupid ass song on the interlude.  Grrr..."
1,Your have achieved legend status with your reviews man. Get rid of those damn glasses lol there's no mistaking you for anyone else if you were to rock some aviators. Them Janis joplin glasses are what we think of if some guy was peeking through our windows
1,Interesting reviews as always. The inbetween musical numbers could be missed. Love your work anyway
0,I'm not getting the idea of the beer opener.  Why the F would you want to drink your beer that way?
1,"Hello There! That smelling cup made me think of Airup, a German product claiming the same.... Tricking your Brain. If you Can review it if It's for sale in the US... Great reviews, Always fun to watch!"
2,Is it just me or does it seem like his teeth are clenched together when he’s speaking?
2,So no one else mentioned the tiger or giant cat that walked by in the background at 3:37 ?
0,Lol that ice cube thing is deffnently trash. Maybe it was a good way to reuse unusable materials or something.  If nothing els they have created a genuine unusable collection of material. It's a multifunctional household tool it fills up your trash can wets your counter top for you so you can wipe it off and pollutes the earth all at the same time I'm amazed at this product lol
2,Biodegradable isn’t about water degradation it’s how it degrades in soil. 🙃
0,I hate that crappy products are allowed to be sold! I don't even buy something online anymore without checking a review first.
0,Your TEETH are really  distracting  ......¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2,"Tbf to the smart cup, just because it's ""bioplastic"" doesn't make it biodegradable.
Not all bioplastic is the same, bioplastic made without oil does biodegrade overtime but  many companies that still use oil as the base component with minerals as supplement components to classify as bioplastic don't biodegrade faster than regular plastic at all."
0,"Why invent a can opening product for cans that have built in opening tabs? We don't need new can openers we just need to use top quality material to make the ones that work already
And ""cooling water"" is clearly a gimmick"
2,We gonna ignore that he had a different outfit for each segment ?
2,"to be fair to Alien Tape, you live on the surface of the Sun. I don't think they accounted for the tape itself melting"
0,They have a USB clothes washer that's exactly the same as the USB dishwasher.  They probably had a factory full of that garbage and paid let's see if we can lose a few calling it something different
2,Personally I think you just had a bad I experience with the draft top I met the guy who made them and it seemed pretty easy to me but we can all have different opinions
2,Why wouldn’t you spend the $3 & drink FLAVORED water?
2,"Because if you put “TAC” in front of it, guys’ll like it. 🙄😂"
2,This is not a critic. I bought Granitestone cookware. I think.the product you tested was Granite rock. Only bought a few pieces. They stopped being nonstick after three uses. I know how to take care of kitchen utensils. I don't use metal and I washes by hand lightly. Can you complain to the company. Please. Love you. Carey Johnston.

2,The perk of the can thing is to down a beer way faster
0,Biodegradable is NOT WATER SOLUBLE. Why do people think this
2,Them sunglasses.
2,Instead of a power pod i got a 20000  mah battery bank for get this 14 dollars
2,"They sell them ""Power Pods"" in  poundland in the UK. Single use, but 900mah for £1... handy if you're out and need a little too up"
2,You look like you talk with your teeth closed
1,He looks great in a suit
0,"These products have virtually no actual R&D and are made cheaply. I wonder how many they each have to sell to make a profit. They would have to predict how many they would sell so they don't eat their profits in unsold inventory. The biodegradable cup kills me. The manufacturing of it is harmful to the environment. So, even if it is really biodegradable, it is single use as you said."
2,Might use the tac amplifier to sound like a 50s radio host
0,"Lots of wasted time in this video with your logo in-between each number, would consider just sticking to the number. Stopped watching halfway."
0,"You said 'suposibly' when speaking about the swivel tray.. *sigh* please correct that word.
Supposedly. There is no 'b' in that word.
I never heard of any one of these products and I can't say I missed out.
I wouldn't have bought a single one, even if I saw them on 'as seen on tv' or any other location.
Every one looks like cheap chinese knock-off crap that is designed to cheat you out of money."
0,Products that solve a problem that doesn’t exist.
2,Bioplastic is not the same thing as  biodegradable plastic.
2,"The Power Pod was obviously meant for emergencies - not for fully charging your phone.

This is my first time watching one of your videos on YouTube, and that was my first impression of you.

That Power Pod is obviously so that one ALWAYS has something on them to charge their phone with no matter what (that's why they made it a keychain). 

You probably think reserve parachute is a bad product too - because they are much smaller and flimsier than other parachutes that you can buy - 🤣

Or maybe you think those tiny reserve scuba tanks are a bad too because they have small air capacity 🤣🤣

Like, did you really not understand the concept? 

They intentionally made it as small as possible so it wasn't an overly bulky keychain.

People who would use this product would have a normal cell phone power bank/s also, and then only resort to using the Power Pod when they are in a bind, as a last resort when they're stranded somewhere.

It is actually a personal safety device like pepper spray.

Maybe you think that tiny pepper spray products aren't good either, since there are big bottles of bear spray available to buy 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2,But wait!! There’s more!!
1,"Couldn't help but to notice that big mandelbrot set on the wall.  Now THAT is a product I would buy — big fan of emergence theory, fractal theory, and chaos theory.  Unfortunately, those products — and we have em here in Japan too — are bad exemplars of those theories.  Cheers!"
1,Those circle sunglasses are snazzy as heck and you're one of the few people I've seen pull them off so well.
0,Coming soon to a landfill near you!
2,Yo when did Jhonny sins start doing product reviews
2,"I get that the cup in the last clip was bad, but why do you say carbonated drinks are bad for kids? Carbonation is just co2... no sugar etc. Maybe THIS cup has sugar, or whatever, but carbonated drinks get that label for the co2 in them, not the sugar or alcohol..."
2,"The issue with some of these isn't necessarily that they're bad products, but that the marketing is beyond the scope of the people who would benefit from them. The can opener, amplifier, and swivel tray in particular are clearly designed with people with disabilities in mind, but they wouldn't turn as much of a profit if they sold them as hearing aids and manual dexterity assistive devices."
2,"Bio plastic needs bacteria to break it down. Water will not break it down, it is designed to hold water. It takes about 20-30 years to break down as opposed to 1 million years."

1,I like that you credited them this time 👍🏻
2,where to paly this?
2,"Idea for your game:

Beds
Beds are for spawn points, so if you lose you spawn there. But its a one time use

Skeletons with weapons
Skeletons can have weapons which can be dropped

Tree lord
Another boss fight with the ability to summon snetient tree enemies which are tree enemies that can move

Ent
Peaceful creature but gets angry after an amount of tree cut down (Common number: 20-40)

Cow
Able to be killed for steak (Heals 2 HP)

Exploding Zombie
Zombie but explodes upon death

Minigun
Low accuracy, high fire rate

And fianlly. Goblins
Steals points and acts like small zombie"

2,Make a skeleton boss
2,if u give me 1k dollars i lock myself in my house for 3 months and come back to u with a complete game xD
2,How can I play?
1,"The game looks more polished, sure, but it's not worth the $500 imo. I was expecting a MAJOR graphics update for that money, considering it's just PIXEL ART, so it's not as hard to draw comparing to normal art. But if you're happy, that's all that matters."
2,What about add a new gun rpg and a knife flowing 🎉
2,where can i play the game?
2,i think in my opinion badgamedev shold add armour and a shield he should also add resorces like iron to upgrade the weapon bullet i dont know badgamedev may add this who knows only god knows
2,"My Idea:
Add Colors to the weapons because they are just white so i think it would be cool to give the weapon colors"
2,Game release when?
2,"Boss fight idea:the king
The king dont move, he just stays in his throne
He have as much health as the player
There are armored zombie circleling around the king protecting the king and the armored zombie have 2x more health than normal armored zombie and you can kill it so it is easier to damage the king
And this boss have 3 phases
Phase one have 5 armored zombie
Phase two have 10 and
Phase three have 15 and he can turn normal zombie into giant zombie"
2,"Is it just me or the first game devs stuff was not shown in the updated version.
Like they put all that effort into three new enemies and a new boss and from what I know they all got scrapped."
1,This came looks like it’s coming along
1,"What is the point of concept art if it more or less reflects how the game looks?

I thought concept art was meant to guide the art direction of the game from the beginning. For instance I used Dalle 2 to make a rain forest that I based my game's art design off of. In this case it looks like the concept art was based off the final look, unless it was meant to help refine the art maybe? I don't know. 

Either way, this game looks great and hats off to all the talented people that helped level it up!"
0,"""the overall graphics have improved""
the graphics:"
2,"you should add ""bullet"" system, convert wood block into wood bullet, and ""stone/ore "" blocks into iron bullets and ""bones loot"" from dead zombies into bones bullet....

Add Vampire who are immune to any damage except wood bullet,  iron bullet deals more damage and bones bullet were casual bullets.

force the player to play with supplies and limited inventory space to fight different kind of monster waves :)"

2,"Question about the prime pyramid, would the sequence still break if we used another base? (i.e. Would the same sequence in base 16, break at 16?)"
0,I usually love these videos and 3B1B of course but I couldn't feel but cheated on this one. A 10 min video describing a pattern that breaks at such a small number like 33 is so trivially uninteresting.
0,did i just got clickbaited with a nerdy maths video?
2,"According to what you said about it being related to the number of fractions with a maximum denominator, this can compute primes! You just need to check how many numbers are added at each step and for step i, if i-1 numbers were added, then i is prime. I checked up to i=3000 too."
0,"06:15 -- honestly, this video, from initially super exciting to me, eventually became super disappointing...
this precise detail is what drew my attention and made this pyramid super interesting to me,

2,"There is a pattern in the pyramid.  If you have a row n, then you will see that number in the row (n - 1) times.  For row 2, the number two appears once (2 - 1 = 1). 

The algorithm for building the pyramid and doing this test would not be an efficient method for finding primes."
2,so if 17 is left out does that mean that it is a super prime? then i would venture out and say that it is a safe bet that there are more primes that would be skipped in doing it this way.
2,"Why do Americans say ""three fourths"" instead of ""three quarters""?"
2,"probably the most fascinating prime pattern that tricks everybody the most is the approximating prime-counting function which leads to the birth of skewes number. even tho skewes number is an over-overestimate i guess the actually point where the prime-counting function changes its size comparison to the actual number of primes < n would still be something huge (like 10 to the power several hundreds?). this completely blasts through the regime of small numbers a mortal could interpret of, but yet at some point the relatively big boys still gonna break the pattern."

2,"The length of successive Farey sequences is OEIS A005728. The Euler totient function is one of the foundational objects of number theory. The fact that the sequence here is one plus the sum of the first n values of the totient function is another of those neat links that almost feel numerological in nature. If memory serves, there have already been Numberphile videos on the link between the Stern-Brocot tree and Farey sequences on the one hand, and Farey sequences and Ford circles on the other."
2,"After realizing that the total number of DIGITS in the 10th row stays prime (37), I got hopeful that maybe the number of digits would keep the pattern even if the number of elements (numbers) doesn’t. 

But alas, at the 11th row the number of digits is 37+2*φ(11), or 57… 😕"

1,"Aaaauuuggghhhh!!!! Stop saying ""Vehicle"" instead of Vertical""!!!

Otherwise, very fun video. Most of this stuff is still just barely not fiction. All the electric aircraft shown are hoping for battery improvements that are hoped for, but not yet measuring up to their hype.

It's funny that a lot of the stability software is  off-the-shelf drone stuff.

The LM (or LMV) 496 (depending on when he says it) is obviously a mock-up with a piston engine.

The mispronunciations are annoying. Please look up chassis, aether, mobile, etc. and learn some aviation basics. Duct is not the same as ducted. Vertical and horizontal takeoff are not the same (Uber Air). Talking about a single propellor for horizontal flight while showing a 4 rotor tilt system (also Uber Air) is just maddening.

Mixing mock-ups with proof-of-concept vehicles makes everything look fake. (I realize you're using footage from people trying to showcase a product, but you should note the differences. The MK-3, moving from an 8-rotor configuration to a ducted jet, is the worst example. (And don't use the word ""mid-air"" to mean ""flying"", or ""aloft"" or ""in three dimensions"". Mid-air refers to a crash between two airborne vehicles.

Your numbers of flights and distances by A3 are just illogical. Largest distance flown 5,024km? In 19 minutes? Puts the SR-71 to shame. Maybe that should have been a decimal.

Get some friends. Particularly a friend with aviation background. Use them for editing. Take their advice."

The sleek shape of the Aether Airship looks very much like some aircraft and automobile designs Syd  Mead created in the 70s, 80s and 90s. Indeed, there is a YouTube video out in the world that shows Syd Mead working on a painting called ""Airship Arrival"" showing that the Aether Airship, and it's design, are not entirely new or original to Aether Airship."

2,"The best electric drones no matter what size 1 foot model or 100 foot giant drone can only fly about 5 minutes to an hour at about 50 mph .
    The longer flight times sacrifice speed and strength and weight and ability to handle wind or breezes .  So a drone car might get 5 mile range at $300 per pound . It might take 100 hour for a large car battery size expensive charger to charge for the 2 mile out and back flight ."

2,"Now people will see white planets floating in the sky everywhere.

- 예슈아커밍 / Yeshua Coming -

I will share my vision on September 19, 2022.

Looking at the southern sky. A very large white planet appears white colour and floating with the clouds. People are muttering around looking at the round white planet that's too big. What's that? And start talking while wondering.

And when I looked in the western sky, there was a big white planet.

Wow! Now a white planet appears in front of people's eyes. I have to grab my camera and shoot that. I need to take a picture of White planet.

It is a short snapshot vision, but God wants His sons and daughters to be spiritually awake in real time.

Now very soon you will see white planets here and there.

The Earth is round, people around the world have different time zones, and you will see a white planet from your own location.

Now the white planet is being captured by the FAA weather webcam.

However, with the sun's rays, fine dust, and chemtrails spraying like crazy, you won't have many chances to see the sky.

However, now the white planet is approaching very quickly, and what you see at sunrise and sunset is now almost from morning to evening, from sunrise to sunset, if you observe the sun in detail. You can be witnessed very well in its surroundings.

It is most clearly seen in the Wolf Creek pass area, and from sunrise to sunset, even in broad daylight, it can now be observed very clearly in clear weather.

Yeshua God is coming very soon.

At the very least, the Creator is coming, as creatures, must have the courtesy to look up at the sky.

Until the day when 16,000,000,000 eyeballs see the sky, Yeshua Coming will fulfill the role of the Heavenly News broadcast.

Be praised forever, be worshiped forever, and be loyal to the President of the Top of Heaven forever, Yahweh, Holy Spirit, Yeshua!

Only Yeshua!

Sep 19 2022 Now people will see white planets floating in the sky everywhere.

2,"Judgment on the Nations 
A noise will come to the ends of the earth--
For the LORD has (charges, a case) a controversy with the nations; 
He will plead His case with all flesh. 
He will give those who are wicked(unbelieving in Him and His Son, lawless, not worshipping Him) to the sword’, says the LORD.”
Thus says the LORD of hosts:
“Behold, disaster shall go forth 
From nation to nation, 
And a great whirlwind shall be raised up
From the farthest parts of the earth. 
And at that day the slain of the LORD shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall become refuse on the ground. 
Jeremiah 25:31-33
For the wrath of God(1-eternal wrath, which is hell, 2-the final Day of the LORD;3-cataclysmic wrath like the flood, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; 4-consequential wrath, reap what you sow; 5-removing restraint and letting people go to their sins Psalm 81:11, 12; Proverbs 1:23-31) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead(divine nature, deity), so that they are without excuse because although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man --and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. Romans 1:18-23. 
Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4:16
Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain. 
For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures(Genesis 1:9-13; 2 Kings 20:8; Psalm 16:9-11; 110:1; Isaiah 53:10; Hosea 6:2; Jonah 1:17; 2:10; Matthew 12:39, 40; Mark 8:31; Luke 11:29, 30; 24:26; John 2:19-21; Acts 2:25), and that He was seen by Cephas(Peter), then by the twelve. (the Catholic Church is a false church that teaching only leads to hell). After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. 1 Corinthians 15:1-6. 
From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand(near). Matthew 4:17
So the LORD God said to the serpent(physical serpent/spiritual serpent, the lying deceiver, Satan): 
“Because you have done this, 
You are cursed more than all cattle, 
And more than every beast of the field;
On your belly you shall go, (they had legs before)
And you shall eat the dust
All the days of your life. 
And I will put enmity(mutual hatred)
Between you and the woman(Eve),
And between your seed(Satan and unbelievers, who are called the Devil’s children in John 8:44) and her Seed(Jesus of Nazareth, and those in Him); 
He shall bruise your head, 
And you shall bruise His heel.”
Genesis 3:14-15
Read Luke 1:26-38; 
Jesus as Messiah...”But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” Mark 2:10
Jesus came to earth to give up His life and to save those who come to Him as our only Lord and Savior, those who confess their sins and unbelief. Jesus at 30 chose twelve disciples as witnesses, preached the gospel, healed the sick, cast out demons, and fed thousands. At 33, He was accused of blasphemy, scourged, hung with nails on the cross, and died. Our sins were laid on Him. He was buried in a tomb. Three days later He rose again, resurrected. Jesus is the Son of God and is God and co-creator. He led a righteous life which we can not do. His righteousness becomes our righteousness when we believe. Jesus was the unblemished, perfect sacrifice. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23
We have broken the Ten Commandments. 
And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this:’You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Mark 12:30-31. 
Have no other gods before me(Budha, practiced yoga, Catholicism teaches to worship Mary as a virgin, and saints and angels, Vishnu, other Indian gods, Asian gods, Allah, Satan) 
Turning others into your gods. Like celebrities, athletes, Emperors, and religious leaders. 
Have you made idols? 
Have you taken the name of God in vain(omg) and Jesus and said holy__? 
Have you disobeyed your parent(s) the one(s) who raised you? 
Have you murdered(abortion, killed someone)? Do you support abortion? Why do they not say abortion but pro-choice? 
Have you looked at another with lust? Have you slept with someone who is not your spouse? 
Have you ever stolen? Money, car, clothes. 
Have you lied? Have you not been a good witness? 
Have you wanted more and more? Have you wanted something that your sibling, relative, friend, or co-worker has? Like their spouse, house, and car. 
Do you believe God created the Earth and heavens and seas and everything in them? 
Do you believe He sent His Son Jesus to save you? 
Under God you are deserving of punishment for disobedience to Him. God is a God of justice. 
He wants you to confess, ask for forgiveness, repent, turn back to Him, to give back what you stole or pay for it, to forgive and come under His grace or you are going to hell. 
Hell, then Judgment Day, then forever in the Lake of 🔥 Fire. 
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Galatians 6:7

John MacArthur notes”Yet only those who see their own helplessness in the face of sin can come to see how gracious God has been in acting and choosing ahead of time. 
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8
He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. John 3:36
Coming is the Great Day of the LORD
That day is a day of wrath, 
A day of trouble and distress,
A day of devastation and desolation, 
A day of darkness and gloominess, 
A day of clouds and thick darkness, Zephaniah 1:15
For this a day of the Lord GOD of hosts, 
A day of vengeance, 
That He may avenge Himself on His adversaries, 
The sword shall devour;
It shall be satiated and made 
drunk with their blood;
For the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice 
In the north country by the River Euphrates. Jeremiah 46:10
I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; 
I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation;
I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth
From the great assembly. Psalm 40:10

You gave me wonderful advice on how I should go with Python because it was easy and intuitive. I took your advice and learned the fundamentals of programming using Python which sky rocked my learning versus learning 2 languages at the same time. Once I got the fundamentals down learning Python, I jumped onto JavaScript for Web Development and learning JavaScript was a lot easier to pick up than it was previously. Now I have a question?
If I am kind of comfortable with JavaScript where I made some small projects, and I am at the stage where I finished with High Order Array functions, and I am learning now Async Await. After I am done learning this, would you recommend I learn TypeScript afterwards?  Or should I wait a bit longer? It seems TypeScript is for more experienced developers, and I am not. Would love to hear your advice, thank you so much on previous answers."

1,I'm so in love!!!!!  Best rendition of this and I think Beethoven would LOVE it!  I just ordered your sheet music. Can't wait.
2,If I didn't listen to my friend when I was 12 he talked me out of piano cos it was the early 90s and NOONE plays piano anymore. Errr. I would have 30+ years playing. I'm 47 and have 2 years practice approximately 1 to 5 hours 5 to 7 days a week if not everyday.

1,One of the first more difficult pieces I taught myself to play was the first movement of Moonlight Sonata. I absolutely loved the piece and I still do today and play it quite regularly even after all these years. That being said… this was so amazing!!! ❤ To hear Moonlight Sonata played like this gave me a totally different feel for it! And throwing Chopin into the mix? I thought it was wonderful! I also play some of his pieces as well and I think his work and Beethoven’s actually compliment one another’s nicely! This seemed like such an amazing concert that video doesn’t do justice. I may have to come experience it for myself 😊
0,This would be more stupendous if you take out the gaudy comments - the performance is ENOUGH- the comments lower the caliber of this video! Please!
1,Absolutely breathtaking!
1,Bravo 👏
1,"Interesting interpretation.  I wonder how Beethoven would have reacted. 
Not that it's a bad rendition.  In fact it's genius. I'm just used to the original."
1,Epic
1,Spectacular!!!
1,and never missed a single note. wow
1,"i really enjoy the mixture of electronic music with live instruments. one without the other is good, but there's so much magic that happens when the best of both are put together. this isn't my favorite realization of that mixture, but it is a a pretty good example of how the electronic music sounds better to me with a live instrument added."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the sonata.  More power to those who take it upon themselves to interpret music their own, special way.  Kudos!!"

1,This is the most exciting and intense version of this masterpiece. A true virtuoso
1,I absolutely enjoyed every note you played!!!  It was awesome!!!
1,"Don't assume what Beethoven would say or think. He once said ""if you're not going to play my music as written, don't even bother playing it."" Having said that, great job. 👏👏👏👏👏"
1,wow
1,Spectacular!!!!😁
1,It’s not sacrilegious because it’s not the Moonlight. I liked it.

2,Get your ass*&^ off your seats!
1,"Spectacular, for sure"
1,"Sacrilegious? I bet if Beethoven was watching from somewhere, he would say: that's my man :)"
1,It’s an interpretation and a very good one too. If it moves you or brings you joy then it’s achieved what music is meant to do.
1,Definitely spectacular

2,"While he is a suburb player, i prefer that song played as written.  He missed crucial parts that give this sonata the terrible haunting beauty that made it famous for all time.  This is a different song altogether."

1,"A bit sacrilegious, but really good."
2,I think Beethoven and Chopin would appreciate this greatly given they were musical visionaries of their era. Nothing different here with this...merely an evolution of something that started off as epic.

1,BRAVO!!!! well done!!!!
1,WOW!! INCREDIBLE!
1,Most exciting version I’ve ever heard. Amazing.
1,damn good i f ing love it
1,"1) so beautiful :) no more words needed...  2) Strange that people nowadys say but Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt played it that way, so it has to be that way... First, who was there to listen to them? Did they really played it the all the way we think today they did? Secondly, if these guys were playing mainstream back in time, no one would remember them. THEY were exactly the people who went off the lines to create something new, so why should you be afraid of doing it?"
1,I thought it was beautiful! Thank you.
1,Great raping music!
1,"My gee... This gave me chills... Your talent is SUPERB dude, congratulations!"
1,Spectacular!!! It made me emotional! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

1,Awesome!
1,absolutely spectacular!!!!!
1,This is MAGNIFICENT.
1,Took my breath away. Wow
1,"""Sounds that Kennedy center has never heard.""

I hope people grasp the gravitas of that statement.
This is a big moment in cultural history.

I know some purists who'd consider this sacrilegious, profaning the genius of masters or whatever, but I see it the other way around. Music being the language of the soul, in my opinion, it seems sacrilegious to stifle creativity with the overbearing weight of tradition. After all, there's nothing stopping them from putting in the practice to play how _they_ want. Besides, a stagnant culture is a boring culture and this is certified dope."
1,"How did that audience not burst to their feet in applause at the end?????  If that performance doesn't move you, you're dead inside."
1,Cool

Is that possibly a thing, or did I just have a really weird dream/trip sometime?
As one gets older, years seem to take less and less time to pass, probably because each year represents less of a fraction of our accrued age, but does that mean that by the time a giant Galapagos tortoise gets to 150 the years are flying by?
Just wondering is all..."
2,10:25 many people report  seeing layers of distorted fields with psychedelic mushrooms. They allow Different parts of the brain to communicate directly that normally aren’t able to. Seems plausible to me that some of these distortions could be magnetic fields we do not normally see. We seem to have the “hardware” necessary. Would be interesting to learn if we can control/activate the cryptochromes within us.

0,"hey, i love your videos, but i think it is important to think critically about the things you say in the sponsor segments. these VPN providers claim to help in security, but VPNs dont protect from malware or ""hackers"". they only make it appear that you access the internet from somewhere else. they provide great value if you want to access geolocked content, but thats about it. the new wave of VPN providers advertise their services as something they are not and it is important to call that out. if you want more details, the channel LiveOverflow made a great introductory video about this topic, where he also explains why ""hiding your IP"" is not relevant to security for the target audience of these VPN ads.
NORD may bundle their VPN service with AV add-ons and that is really cool to see, but the ongoing confusion between VPNs and actual security related stuff is exploiting consumers and this needs to stop. consumers need to be able to make purchase decisions based on facts. there are now people who pay for a service, thinking they are protected against things that arent actually covered by the product they pay for."
2,"Catfish getting a taste for humans or other mammals isn’t that unheard of.

Wels catfish (also known as sheatfish) can grow to over 3m (9.8ft) in length and while they mostly eat smaller aquatic animals, they sometimes also ducks, mice, rats and even small dogs. And there are many reports of them getting close to and trying to bite small children that were swimming around, however they don’t succeed because small kids usually are in very shallow waters and have the human instinct of freaking out and leaving the water when a big fish gets too close.
But drowning victims having marks that indicate that catfish ate a part of them isn’t unheard of.

When my dad was a child he and others from his area used to go swimming in a lake that was stocked with fish for fishing and apparently one of the Wels catfish got so big, that the owners of the lake closed it down and had divers with harpoons go after the Wels because it ate a dog and people were getting afraid that it might go for one of the swimming kids."

I hesitated to ask the technician about it for fear they'd think I was doing drugs. He said it was because of the high magnetic field and a few people have reported it to him too but it wasn't common.
2,"Our old dog had liver cancer for a year before she died.  Whenever we went to a park, many of the dogs wanted to sniff her butt, even more than other dogs.

2,And if you don't have fat reserves? Then you go hypoglycemic and die. Stop listening to quacks. You don't have to give up sugar if you use it. Rather take up sport and a healthy diet and use sugar in moderation or when needed. This advice is only applicable if you're overweight and not doing any exercise.
2,"Isn’t there is a significant difference between cane & cheap white beet store sugar.  Domino brand white sugar is supposed to be cane.  I’ve switch to the light brown Morena pure cane sugar that has the butterfly non GMO certified but am wondering if this is less harmful than non cane sugar.  I use it for coffee & tea.  I drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning & one cup of tea at night.  I try to avoid sweets as no doubt they don’t make them w/pure cane sugar but that’s rough when you like dark chocolate, pudding, etc."
2,What about fruits? Don't they contain sugar?
2,"Sugar is actually good for you. It’s fructose, levulose; it’s God given nutrition from a natural plant, a healthful tall grass.
Blaming sugar for illness or ailments is as blaming fish for brain degeneration; it’s not the fish, it’s “secretly” the mercury, the toxin mineral polluting our food supply. 
It’s the same with sugar. There is a covert toxin not being reported by mainstream professionals."

I am diabetic, not on meds.  I exercise more but haven't cut sugars, I LOVE everything sweet.

Sorry, but this doctor doesn't know the facts behinds the video. Read something on internet and made a video? Everyone knows sugar is bad or actually its the fructose part (50%) specifically in sugar that fattens you up REAL QUICK as fructose can be converted to fat via the liver basically with no pathways. Time to study doctor:) But goid advice overall to cut out sugar, but isn't that obvious to everyone by now?"

I got trapped in the middle of the us by poverty and now it’s 4 walls and a screen, to the next four walls and a screen. Our city is not safe at all, I can’t even let my kid outside to play like a normal kid. I understand there’s aspects to this that would hurt someone probably but I’m ready for the giant emp… just wipe it all out.

2,"This is mad, I'm still not clear on why so many people chose to live on one small unremarkable island however. Is it because the fishing grounds are so good? Whats wrong with the neighbouring islands which I think I saw?"
2,"Im thinking this arrangement ""might"" work best if everyone was from the same culture.
Its hard enough living in crowded conditions with folks that look and believe like you do."
2,There is hardly any fish there. Maybe they can look around the piers of the island. If everyone is so dependent on the fish I can see how it will be hard for the reefs to repopulate.

2,My theory is that LTT was social engineered to purchase and test this product. Bots and alt accounts promoting this product to the writers. Maybe that's the only one they've ever sold and it was made for this video.
2,"If someone bought this, they are part of the problem! Any serious audiophile knows the difference between digital and analog signals."
2,Is it wrong that I kinda wish I'd thought of this first...
2,"Streamed audio is first collected by a local RAM buffer on your PC before any of the data is converted to audio. Network jitter is irrelevant as it only exists on the way to this buffer but the buffer entirely eliminates any jitter and if there is jitter between your RAM and your sound chip, no external network device can reduce that. However, the test in the video is useless at it isn't double blind. Only double blind tests count, that means neither the test subject nor the tester must know at any time if they are using one device or the other one; both need to be blind to what's going on in the test as only then they cannot be influenced by imagination (test subject) or influence by providing subliminal hints (tester)."
2,Maybe a Telefunken 12ax7 would help if you glued it to the cat 6 cable. I do think all that glue does make it mil spec for vibrations so there is some value there.

0,"just another reason NOT to buy any Dlink products. A company conspiring to such a ridiculous rip off simply cannot be trusted.  I get it that they are just trying to extort money from audiophools who have absolutely NO idea of the physics of analogue and digital signals but blatant lies in their product description and obvious completely fraudulent marketing claims are just screaming out for their company to be sued off the face of the Earth.   Come on people,!  there are laws to deal with this.  Whatever way they try to justify it THIS IS BLATANT FRAUD.  Get these lying thieves dragged into court and stop them stealing peoples money. Even audiophools with more money than braincells should be protected from such a pathetically stupid scam."

2,If anyone is thinking of trying signalrgb DO NOT DO IT. They dont support most stuff and doesnt even work on all games.  They dont even have a screen sync option like other rgb controller apps
0,"Its like guitar mythts that people swear by. If i wrap it a certain way i get more sustain. If i clean it under a full moon the strings last longer. Its hilarious that it exsists, its horrifying people believe it."
2,"Though this ""audiophile"" stuff is obviously a scam, I would like to point out that yes - capacitors can be ""fast"". And it has quite a big impact on electronic design. Different capacitors have different self-resonant frequency above which they start to act as inductors and it very noticeable between most popular types. To simplify things - slower capacitors do not work at high (200MHz+) frequencies. For example you should not use an electrolytic capacitor for microprocessor voltage stabilization as it is just not as good as a ceramic capacitor.
Obviously it is way out of audible spectrum. I am pretty sure you would be able to use li-on battery as stabilizer for 20kHz frequency ;P

What would be important for audio solutions is capacitor parameters consistency over a wide span of temperatures/humidity/lifetime etc.
Apparently there also is parameter sometimes called microphonics - some capacitors happen to work as very weak microphones. THAT is something that sounds (hihi) important for audio amplifiers. But I doubt that those scam companies would know about such a thing. Yeah.. and at the very end it doesn't matter when we are talking about digital transmission."

0,"It blows my mind how much nonsense there is out there. 
But at the same time, it also surprises me how much people just don't understand computers or electricity at all. 
For instance cables with direction?
Audio is AC. Alternating current. 
If there is a direction to the cable, then it would affect half the cycle of the audio waveform more than the other. 
This type of asymmetric distortion is highly sought after by guitarists, producers and synthesizer nerds. 
Audiophiles not so much. 

As far as audiophile computer stuff. It's preying on people's ignorance of computers in this same way. 
Sure there is jitter introduced by the network. However the data that is transmitted across the network is not sent as discrete slices of audio at the sample rate. 
It's sent as packets wrapped in protocol layers. The audio is chunked in whatever way is convenient for the sending application and receiving applicaiton to negotiate .
Then it is cached on the local system and played back according to the clock reference of the soundcard. 

Any application that plays audio across a network (like your bnrowser) is going to cache data before playback. 
Two reasons, UDP and TCP. These are the transport protocols of TCP/IP. 
The first one will do synchronous delivery, but gives no guarantee of packet delivery. It just shoots packet out in a series and counts on your NIC to catch them. If there is other network traffic oh well. 
The second protocol, TCP does provide fault tolerant delivery, but this adds overhead to the data stream (about 20%) and it is asynchronous. 
Both of these are more than fast enough to transmit audio data at rates which are listenable. But there is a lag, which we call latency as well. 
So with either one you are going to need a cache to stack up data before playback. Again, the soundcard's clock source is the only one that matters to jitter on playback. 
The packets can arrive out of order, upside down and backwards. But since they are played back from a cache it doesn't matter. 
But I'm an IT professional and electronics hobbyist that builds mics preamps and EQs. 
This is a little more obvious to me I suppose."

2,"If we were to think of ways this wouldn't be complete bullshit, it would probably have to do with the analog side hums and electrical isolation.
It could also maybe have some weird QoS prioritization for streaming to ensure it doesn't get throttled down. Though, since the switch probably isn't your bandwidth bottleneck, it can't have much effect there. If it's not the bottleneck, the switch can't really detect when a stream's bandwidth starts getting eaten by other traffic, meaning it won't know when to slow down the rest of it."
2,"Some tens years ago one home audio magazaine made a blind test of, how they called it, ""a new high end equipment developed specifically for jazz music"". They invited a bunch of audiophile experts, located them in front of a sound-transparent curtain and played a bunch of jazz tracks, waiting for expert reviews.
All of the experts have found flaws of some kind in the music they heard, calling it unnatural, lacking some frequency ranges, compressed, not-airy-enough etc.
Then the curtain was opened and it reveiled a.... live jazz band. Live band which played live music which those so-called experts called ""unnatural""."

2,"65 Yo retired electronics technician. The only thing all that glue and stickers is going to do, is help the device burning your house down when those capacitors get old (quicker than D-Link) due to holding in any heat, and overheating them faster. The cover over the crystal might increase its aging process, (going out of spec faster), rather than help. You can indeed get faster capacitors, all that means is they are going to have less capacitance. In reality the better thing to do with capacitors is to use higher quality and longer lasting types. I have built devices that have crystal heaters and covers, but the crystal is cut differently, and is made to be held at a specific temperature to stay in spec. longer. 
(In my application, the crystal is held at 40 degrees Centigrade, by a heater and thermocouple, and encased in a fibreglass blanket, which is in turn in a Mica box wrapped with foam and finally in a silver-plated brass box, with anti-shock mounts.)"

2,"I'm surprised they didn't put an *audio pro* sticker on the box.. That alone would be worth at least 500 more. As an artist and music producer, I'm acutely aware of subtleties, esp in masters, where there is a clear difference between formats.. Side by side comparisons of CD, HD and MP3 masters are obvious. At no point in the digital signal chain (high end or not) is there a difference, the only thing that does matter in an extensive audio rig is a clock source where everything is strictly controlled, where midi data, multiple hardware synths etc are timed precisely, latency corrected and clock jitter and voltage irregularities smoothed out. This is where money is well spent, not in these consumer grade *audiophile hop ups."

0,"The only way this could possibly ""enhance"" audio quality is if they place the switch right next to or ontop/below an analog component (DAC, preamp or amp) and the switch generates RF ""noise"", in a similar manner to what you hear when you lay your mobile phone close to a speaker and you receive a call or something. (eg there is radio communication going on to the cell tower)
Since a modern gigabit switch contains a ""relatively"" fast microprocessor (which generates RF noise) and possibly a cheap noisy switching power supply, this ""could"" have an effect on sound quality, but, to fix that these snake-oil salesmen would simply have had to add good RF shielding to the switch (or design a different, larger enclosure for the switch with a thick metal RF shielding cage) which they did not do, so I don't see the point here...
If I had a $100K audiophile sound setup and were adding a switch that's located right next to or on top of analog components, I would pay a ""reasonable"" extra (like $50 or so) for a modified switch with good RF shielding inside, and which is also marketed as such.  But I would never pay $800 instead of $30 for a snake-oil product like this which claims to ""enhance"" audio quality."

You can improve throughput with better equipment, like higher quality cables that reduce error rates or switches with lower latency. Which doesn't matter for low bandwidth use cases like audio. And the data gets also buffered before being processed and sent to the speakers/headphones - also to compensate for transmission errors/lags. Even worse: if you tamper with the digital data you will inevitably destroy/damage it. An altered encrypted packet like used in streaming can not be decrypted anymore, so you will damage the data and instead of fine music you'll get an error in the listening app..."

A friend who visited told me that these sound better to him than the 5000€ hifi system his dad owns, so he bought a pair as well.
I was hooking them up to my PC through optical SPDIF from my sound card, which is important as onboard analog audio always has lots of interference from EM noise from other PC components. 

One of the very worst that I've listened to, on the other hand, was a speaker set made by an ""audiophile"" company that an acquaintance bought for around 50€ second hand that had a list price of 1300€ when new (around 20 years ago).

2,"Prior to destroying the device, did you try the blind test with a UDP connection instead of TCP? I am assuming that the product was designed for home theater systems, which probably use UDP to minimize audio latency (i.e. to ensure synchronization with the video feed).

Obviously you are correct that one might not hear a huge difference on TCP due to error correction, but this comes at the cost of latency, which is likely an important factor in home theater applications and is clearly not what the product was designed for."

2,"its an action cam .. not a desktop cam .. basically its designed to have airflow over the unit .. i use myn for freestyle drone flying i turn it on last and tell it to start recording from my phone ..

having gone thru several different action cams the hero9 has been the best 1 for what i use it for.. many cams literally just slow down to cool off meaning u start not getting 60fps the runcam 1 i had last for eg went down to around 4fps even if i was zipping thru the air at 105mph it was utterly garbage .. runcam were like oh its the SD card .. well i use the exact same SD card in my gopro and well no problems as of yet XD 

i have to say iv never had the over heat .. tho i can feel it gets really hot 

if i was to tell gopro how to upgrade .. titanium white not graphite black .. gosh that thing can boil and egg in the warm sun if its just sitting on the table outside"
2,My gopro 10 fell 300ft attached to my drone and didn't even get a scratch. Try that with the dji action 2.
2,"See it reminds me of the iPod. iPod even at the time was not even close to the best. It was just marketed like hell. Which is why people bought so many of them. 

Marketing what do you mean? Everything from how it is advertised to how it is displayed in stores. Think about how they used marketing to get your attention. There always was a better product. It just never spent as much as them on marketing the product.

In the case of the iPod, while Apple was releasing the iPod. Sony already had a full-color screen device that could play mp4s. It was just due to marketing that Apple became so famous. Also, they did not develop or design the iPod. They bought from someone else. Much like 99% of Apple products. 

The only thing they may have done was changed how it interacted. Making it an entire system trapping you when you commit to it."
2,Who is everyone? And many are they?
0,And for my own experience the last five years being a GoPro premium member with a subscription. They made it hell to warranty your cameras by making it difficult for you to correspond with customer service that usually located across the globe. As well as they’ve sent me the wrong camera before and I sent it back to them and they refused to send me my camera because they messed up. Don’t waste your money with these people and their cameras aren’t even good enough to keep up with the competition these days. There’s so many great alternatives look up Insta 360 if you’re looking for a new camera that can do it all and has great easy software with me way better customer service.
2,"My hero 6 black wasn't perfect.  I could feel it getting hot sometimes.  Also it used to give false battery level status,  but recently gone completely dead for no obvious reason. RIP goPro  I'll probably go for DJI as next action camera"
2,insta360 one also freezes randomly but much less.
2,interesting. Who are the main competitors. I have german made action camera.
2,My GoPro 7 will turn on in my pocket and record for the full 30min the battery lasts. No overheating there
1,"Also lack of innovaton, I have seen 360 cams back in 2012 or so and Go pro took waaaay too long to establish some products here. Now the Insta 360 will kill everything else. It´s features are just awesome."
2,"My experience is with a session 4 -  My first an only action cam - First time - I went to snowboard - it was - 12C - cold but not really cold. I take it out put it in the mount and record the first run. Then stopped it and took the lift. At the top of the lift - the camera was not running - battery is too cold. Apparently the action cam is only working when its luke warm outside.
This and the fact I am not doing anything worth recording killed my entusiasm."
2,"My first go pro was a hero 5 session back in 2020, yes it’s outdated, the battery can’t be changed. But it works totally in the ballpark of what I need it for and still have’t upgraded"
2,"I have a GoPro 5, two 8s, Max, 10 and now 11. Never had a single issue... I use my GoPros to make cinematic videos, so i use the highest resolutions. Never had them shutdown from overheating... They are just not meant for shooting long videos and to use indoors. I do agree though that they stayed behind on the innovation front, the competition is getting fierce and GoPro seems to be asleep. I was waiting more from the 11..."
2,"I bought my GPH 10 (first and only) to record a trip of a lifetime - a 10,000klm, 6 week journey through a desert and around Central Australia. Damn thing was useless. Overheated, no matter if I mounted the camera on the inside or outside of the car. 

I wouldn't buy one again. 

Everyone tells me to wind down the FPS from 120 to 60 and the quality down from 5k to 4k. (Then it's only a 4K60fps camera.....)  But that still didnt work. Turn off stabilisation. Turn of this other feature. And that. 

Wasted my AU$800."
2,I've had a 3 silver forever. It crashes all the time. Got an 8 off a friend cheap. It crashes too. Have to run it in 2.7k so it crashes less. Did I mention i only use them under water. Pretty tough to do battery pull at 100 feet. Guess what. Water cooling doesn't help. They are garbage. Luckily i also have a real camera for shooting better video anyway.
2,I bought a gopro used once so far and was not happy with trying to get the video to play without using their software 😠
0,"Already since Hero 3 the hardware issues and firmware bugs were prominent. I dived with a rig of three cameras for a reason. During a dive one cannot take out the battery and heavon known how many dives ended with at least one crashed and non-resettable Hero 3. Also, the terrible battery behavior under water at 8-3°C resulted in premature shut offs. But much worse: trashing mSD cards due to a defective hardware shutdown behavior. I could reproduce this on all my 3 Hero 3, yet GoPro said it was fake SanDisk mSD. Needless to say that SanDisk gave me proof of authenticity for my cards, so GoPro next said that there was no problem at all. I never bought GoPro after their proven lying again, and when asked am advising against any GoPro product based on my first hand experience with GoPro. They simply deserve to go bust."
1,"I have a Hero 8 and it is great.  Beautiful timelapses (hours outside in the un with adapter plug in) and nicely stabilized video without a gimbal.  It overheated a few times because for some timelapses I had it in it's clear case for some protection if it fell, and it was a very hot summer day.  I did the timelapses out of the case and put a shade over it and it was fine."
2,"Dude, i know your voice from some where. Did you have a tech Chanel named something else like 6 years ago?"
0,"“Everyone” isn’t, but good job I guess making a video title so stupid that people are enticed to click on it just to tell you how wrong you are. A ton of people still use Go Pros for all kinds of reasons that other options just aren’t as suited for. Even on the comments of THIS VIDEO, people are mostly talking about how pleased they are with them and that they still use them regularly. Even if you had any decent points in the video itself, no one is going to care if you lead with stupid, idiotic clickbait titles that just irritate people."
2,"Never had an overheating issue with a Gopro, im a diehard Canon user and have had overheating issues...
 
What gets better footage?"
0,I would think it being way over priced would be the main eason
0,"Bought my Hero 10 last year. Was super happy and took it to the Bahamas. When I used it snorkling, I quickly ran into the overheating problem. I thought it was my model that was defective. Nope. It's GoPro's in general. I accepted it telling myself that technology just wasn't there to keep it cool. Now you are telling me there's better action cameras that don't overheat! Now I feel like crap."
2,"i've heard lots of horror stories, but personally all the ones i've owned, including old used and my at the time brand new hero 9 black, have worked pretty much flawlessly"
1,Yessss thank you!!!  My friends all think I’m crazy because I hate on GoPro so much.  I gave them two tries and both versions were trash!  I’m not alone… yessss!
2,"The one thing every premium brand dealing with smart devices should know is to always over size the processor, because if it somehow gets behind on instructions, the product will feel bad, 
Like this is a problem in $100,000 cars"
2,nah stg DJI is taking over the whole game they just need to start selling cameras
0,"This company doesn't innovate, doesn't give a shit about its customers, won't address its reliability issues, is only interest in the ""next"" customer, and overcharges for all of its products ! I was a victim of the HERO 8, and was treated so poorly by their sick joke of tech support, that I vowed not to purchase another GoPro (If ever ?), unless the company could prove it could release a reliable, effectively priced, higher video resolution (6K) camera. Version 11 was just another serious disappointment. 👎🏻"
2,"i have 7 black.. it was expensive for me to have that kind of cam that time.. mine was freezing, can't fully charged and even front screen have been damaged (lines are appear over the time) .. i do not know why .. it's all happened in just few month after i buy that cam 😅"
2,I will be buying a dji osmo action 3 advance this year
2,"i must be really lucky, i have a hero 9 and it never froze on me"
2,That’s me!
2,"I had 4 GoPros
GP2 - worked well until last software update which made it record LRV clips, just like GP3. At this point its reliability ended
GP3 - never had an issue. It was flying in my Phantom 2 and if I ever lost fottage it was always because I forgot to push the button
GP Session (first one) - cool little creature but hates vibrations and sometimes it turned itself off because of them. Overheated once and restart was problematic due to non removable battery
Currently I use GP8 - HyperSmooth is phenomenal but camera has some occasional issues with charging. Also it eats battery like crazy.

I also have Insta360 Go2 mentioned here - concept is cool but execution not so much. You can fry eggs with it so only very short clips are possible, charging case/remote is NOT waterproof which basically kills the idea of taking the camera to water-risky environment and the editing software is THE WORST piece of garbage I ever worked with. Also the main reason why I don't have Insta360 X3 yet. I love the camera but mere thought that I'd have to use it's software is enough to stop me from spending money. 

Maybe I should try DJI this time, see how they evolved."
0,"American company, but made in China. Typical cheap Chinese junk."
2,"I ve been using the hero 11 since a month and gone for a few rides with it ... captured few long videos(5.3k-60) . I have not had any problems with it till now 🤞 ...  I have heard that the freezing issue is something to do when the memory cards arent fast enough for the video being captured , to be written on."
0,This video was sponsored by Dji. No doubt about that. Your face and almost forced grimace are so obvious.
0,"I have a 7 and it never freezes, but it overheats sometimes. I have a hero 9 too and it doesn’t overheat but it freezes (it used to freeze constantly). I formatted the SD cards and it got better, but it’s still good for a freeze once or twice per session.  My next purchase will be something else. Usually one file from a 4 hour session will be corrupt. Sick of it!"
2,Honestly this sounds like a thermal issue. By adding heat pipes connected to external radiator may help solve the freezing black screen issue. There is also the possibility that it's just bad software and/or low-quality components used in construction.  Another possibility is the construction environment. How clean is the cleanroom assembly area?
0,"Any alternative company other then DJI? Them being a Chinese company, I really don't trust them with my data."
0,All my issues with GoPro started when recording at 2.7k or 4k. When I record at 1080p I can record for hours and hours with no issues. Initially I was really disappointed but 2 hours of racing footage took up too much space and now I am okay with this compromise. But wtf - why pay a premium price for a sub-par product.
2,"i would like to see the contour comeback. but with GREAT wifi.  no need for anything fancy. just a good color cam with GREAT wifi.
this application is for use in a ho scale train. so no water proofing. no image stabilizing, etc.
just reliability, and GREAT wifi. sound is not needed, but can be put to use."
2,"Been wanting to buy my first gopro since hero 7 released but until now i havent got one. planning  to use occasionally but it feels like when you buy the latest this year, it feels like it easily get outdated the next year and not much major upgrade every after release.."
0,Abandoning BY WHO? BY YOU?..gopro is still the best in the market .... there's no perfect gadgets..they don't innovate? are you blind? you obviously a gopro hater!
2,"I've had my Hero 8 for a couple of years and take it hiking and get great footage with it, I have a recurring issue with getting a memory card error, necessitating a restart. Thats pretty minor but it still shouldnt be happening...."
0,"Stop buying Chinese rip offs the Chinese do not make crap you are buying, Go buy American version of the products if you want better quality"
0,Lol 📧 sucks 4 u
0,I don't any of these.  But I would never own a DJI as they are totally in the pocket of the Communist Chinese military.  No thanks!
0,Go pro turns off all the time  it sucks..
2,I bought a knock off go pro from Amazon I guess a Chinese model for like $50 and have been using it for years on my motorcycle and twice under water never had any issues might upgrade to a 360 model
2,"I just tried to use my Hero 11 Black for the first time, wanted to record my first airplane solo flight and…it wouldn’t power up. The battery was dead even though I fully charged both batteries a couple months ago. I guess they don’t last that long in storage and I should have checked it in advance."
2,"I've experienced issues of freezing and memory loss, although it's was also my first experience with an action camera in general so I assumed it was mostly human error on my part."
1,I laughed when He was on Shark Tank
1,I agree with all you said
0,I will never purchase another Go Pro...Bought a Hero 7 and it is a POS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"an action camera means you are using it for ACTION, so its not over heating cuz you are using it on the bench in closed in air. this has been de bunked may times before dude. not a valid video or comment on what a go pro can do for ACTION SPORTS, gopro still has the best quality overall. but i use for fpv drones, so im not flying for more than 20mins and doing about 80km/hr while do so, so no way it can over heat."
1,DJI is fantastic. but it has chinese spy software
0,Bought my Hero 9 last year.  I been using it for blogging my gigs & making music video. I’m so excited to use it under water. & then we went to the beach & did island hopping.  First time dipping it into the water it died on me. All the previous footages was corrupted.  Great GoPro!
0,"Damn what a shit perspective, seems to have been made by a 4 years old"
0,"When the company went public, Nick Woodman bought himself a Mega-Yacht and a Private-Jet instead of re-investing in his business. Why would you support someone that holds their customers in contempt!?"
2,"If gopro wanted they could even somewhat ditch the aesthetics (that are relatively unchanged) and just caveman the heat problem by making the case out of billet aluminum, left shiny to reflect heat from the sun.  It would look bad probably, but I think people would HIGHLY prefer a functional camera over one that looks nice."
1,"I will buy a Chinese version for much cheaper , LMFAO 🤣"
0,"A quality reliable camera could easily be made but there’s no money in that. 
You all know you are being used right?"
2,"Damn that sucks, wish they would work on what they are missing. I still have my go pro hero sliver and my two other mini go pros they all still work surprisingly."
0,Worst camera ever..9
0,"I have an 8 black, the screen is garbo it never wants to read my inputs. It's just solidly hot ass in responsiveness. That being said, the picture quality is great but for what I want to use it for, I'd be better off with a dedicated indoor cam."
0,I bought a Hero 9 to use for streaming and what a pain in the ass it is to set it up as a webcam. I actually couldn’t use it for 8 months because they didn’t bother updating the drivers. What a waste.
2,What are some other options besides go pro? I've seen YouTubers pushing the insta360 a lot lately
2,"I've never had a problems with my GoPro 10, but ultimatelly stopped using it after few months because was not happy with the quality (everything in a scene always in focus) and went back to Canon 70D which is 10 years old camera. I know there lot's of people who use GoPro and happy with the results, but it was not my cup of tea."
0,"GoPro Critical Flaws:
1- Large files (footage recorded at 4k) will overheat it and kill batteries fast (or worse)
2- Corrupted files stored on the micro sd storage device inside will cause crashes.
3- If the battery dies while recording, all files stored on it will be corrupted.

Never let a GoPro die while recording, it will turn it into a brick until you get home."
0,"A day in the Go Pro office:

Hero 4: 

""Oh yea this is good"".

""Agreed"".

Hero 5: 

""Right team, only 10% of our users want to use their Go Pros underwater"".

""Ok?""

""So in order to help them, we're gonna make the whole thing waterproof!"".

""...and there's no issues?"".

""Well...."".

""Well what?"".

""Well we need to cover it with a membrane which will make the entire camera have dire audio, pops, clunks and bangs. The lot!"".

""Just to satisfy the 10% who can't be bothered to add a waterproof case?"".

""....that's right!"".

""What. The. F**k?! WHAT OTHER MADNESS WILL YOU BE ADDING?"".

""Oh well less than 5% want digital audio so we're adding a peripheral adapter where you can only use mic with it"".

""......""

""And we'll charge over the odds and make it awkward to attach your mic!"".

""....uh...."".

""And then we'll have multiple delays in production of it!"".

""Can you just... f**k off?"".

Seriously why aren't more people talking about this?"
2,I don't think gopro need to release new cam every year
0,Every person I've ever spoken to who worked for GoPro at any point in their lives has been insufferably full of themselves.
2,"Are they? Are they, really? “Everyone” seems like a pretty broad conclusion"
2,"I bought my first Hero, a 4, new many years ago. I still use it off and on today and thanks to a few friends who bought the 9, 10 and 11 over the years will never go back. They've all had issues with their cameras from the heat to the software freezing. That aside, I can't see spending that kind of money on something like that when I can find something comparable for usually a little less, or at the same price with not nearly the issues GoPro has. 

That being said, my 4 has been GREAT to me, but GoPro is the king no more. Can they coast? Sure, should they? That is the million dollar question."
2,I find the touch screen doesn't work that well in the cold.
0,"Had GoPro 3+, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and it took me long enough to realize it shit year after year."
0,Idiot firmware engineering manager. I stopped at Hero 3 because it was so expensive and non-impressive. Also heated up when  using wireless.
0,Action 2 is an overheating nightmare...worked for 30 seconds out of the box...went back in the box and back to them......
1,I bought go pro 8 years ago for spartan racing not had a single issue.. great quality video and pics!! Maybe i am lucky which would be unusual for me lol!!
2,It's can't be too hard to put a fan in the gopro. It can still be protected from weather and cool the unit.
1,"I've had the 9 since it first came out.  As long as it doesn't get too cold, it works great."
2,I'd like to do some videos of my bike rides but spending $3-4 hundred is a little out of the question. How about some recommendations on the sub $100 units?
1,"Still use my Hero 4 silver and it’s still working perfectly. 
Also like the old buttons and old case concept more."
1,My hero 8 os serving me well so far
0,"3:22 the dude didnt take the plastic off. He cant complain, if he didn't take the plastic off"
0,Too expensive. Batteries suck.
1,Disable wifi and use the screens and buttons. Battery life will be great. Better SD Cards. Voice control is actually great. Update firmware.
1,Still got my 8 and working great! Haven’t updated it once lol
2,"So, whats the best brand/model?"
0,"I’ve got a hero 9 and have had nothing but trouble. 
1) auto upload doesn’t work
2) other connectivity issues
3) SD card errors. Have to format and loose all data 
4) camera freezes after a short while recording. 
Etc etc etc. 

And to top it off their customer service is diabolical"
0,After subscribing to the GoPro plan and getting a new hero 10 it fell into a 1ft deep water hole shorted out the battery because it leeks at almost no water and then telling me that I would have to pay 200$ to get it fixed even though I have their subscription warranty crap. Among the issue of leeking the footage it sometimes laggy missing frames at 1080 24fps I will never buy another GoPro again.
1,"I've had my GOPRO HERO 4 for almost a decade.
It's seen home renovations, weddings, the birth of my children, vacations, work projects, a whole lotta stuff.
It has fallen, bounced, froze, glitched etc.  But, no where near the amount this video is suggesting.
I give my GO PRO HERO 4 a 9.9/10 or 4.9/5"
2,"I had the Hero 8, the model that couldn't use overlays. The wind noise was also shocking. Got a Insta360 X2 and immediately was decided that I'd never buy a GoPro again. Luckily I sold the Hero 8 for not much of a loss."
0,Yeah I've lost SOOOOOOO much great footage by way of the dumb glitches
2,"Bought a hero 4 around 7 years ago, never had any issues with it, still works to this day, even used it for hundreds of hours as a webcam during covid when we worked from home. 

Live in a hot climate (think 30C+ nearly every day year round) and it never overheated, even when using it for motorbike rides. 

Probably wouldn't buy a GoPro again if I were in the market since the competition has clearly surpassed it"
0,"You have a right to be wrong, your Democrat attitude sucks.  Then again who cares."
2,"GoPro doesn't give AF. I see the founder of gopro skiing and shredding snowmobiles all the time with his kids. You would think because he gets after it that he would be his own biggest critic. Constantly pushing the envelope for new features but no, he got rich and that's the end of that."

2,Love my hero 8 but I hate when I'm out surfing and it stops working and I have a dead camra for the rest of the sesh
0,It doesn’t work right.
1,"I like my Go-Pro 8's  mounted on my motorcycle. Works fine, great video recoding altough the camera shakes a lot on my motorcycle no issues."
2,"I get the sense this is a case where the company that defined or even created a product niche - so much that their name is pretty much synonymous with such niche - became complacent and fell behind. Because they were the most well known, they could ride their brand recognition without having to keep their products competitive, or good even, while others - competing against such a giant - have had to innovate and improve to compete. I think this has been seen with a lot of other industries as well, such as software, where the big-name keeps raising their prices and doing all manner of things to piss off customers but as the so-highly-recognized standard they hold their dominance - at least for a while. Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop) comes to mind. Or even Microsoft Office, I still don't know why anyone (including my mom) pays $100 per year when Libreoffice will work just as well for at least 90% of users."
2,"“The only way to get it to work again is to take out the batteries and put them back in like a caveman” 
Its almost like 90% of technology, when facing an issue, just needs a power cycle. I still have to unplug my router when i cant connect, power down my pc when it freezes, and even force restart my iphone on occasion. I dont get how needing to pull out the batteries is a problem, but i can get that its ridiculous that they havent fixed this issue yet after many generations"
0,"You nailed it. GoPro is a joke.  I have 3 and they all have issues with not turning on, wrong date and time, fake file repairs, shutting off randomly, etc.   I've always said they are a great marketing company but do not invest in improving their product for their customers."
2,"Okay, my line of works require GPS telemetry to overlay to the videos, as far as I know only GoPro have this feature. Any action cam alternatives that have GPS and telemetry? If not, unfortunately GoPro is my only way..."
0,"most tech crap has the same problem,all worried about fancy features and
cramming as much as possible,not just gopro suffering from this idiotic crap
but everything tech related.
shifting focus to durability/quality and piss off on cramming dozens of useless 
features in that 99% of people will never use makes more sense,but too many idiots
out there stuck on ""more is better"" over dependability and quality."

2,They should ditched the battery design/etc cause I think that's what holding them back. Who cares if old batteries doesn't fit or vv if they release new gopro every year.

Apparently it's not."
1,This is so true.

1,"GoPro is more than sufficient for my needs! I've been using the hero 9 black but would like to upgrade to the 11 soon.

Our standard poodle when we where visiting some family that is farmers snuck out the door and somehow got into the chicken pen. After looking for the dog for a while it suddenly came running down from where the barn and chicken pen was with two hen's hanging from its mouth by their neck... The dog was so proud for getting the dinner, and then was so confused when we where yelling that she's a bad dog... My uncle that owned the farm said that there had been a fox trying to get to the chickens many times over a few months but was not able to get trough the poultry netting, and i have now idea how the dog managed to do it."
